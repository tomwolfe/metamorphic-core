**Purpose:** This section provides a concise summary of the full specification, focusing *only* on the elements directly relevant to Phase 2 Iteration 2. This is intended to provide an actionable and focused guide for the current development iteration. Refer to the sections below for the full, detailed vision.

**Key Goals for Phase 2 Iteration 2 (from Full Specification):**

*   **Ethical Actionability & Governance (Continued Integration):**
    *   Continue to ensure ethical considerations are integrated into new and enhanced features. As agents become more intelligent and KG integration deepens, ensure ethical policies and principles guide their design and operation.
*   **Automated Quality & Security (Enhancement Focus):**
    *   **Enhanced Code Review:** Improve the `CodeReviewAgent` to perform more sophisticated analysis, potentially using AST parsing for semantic understanding and identifying complex code issues beyond basic style/linting.
    *   **Enhanced Test Generation:** Advance the `TestGenerationAgent` beyond placeholders to generate more intelligent, context-aware tests, potentially guided by code complexity metrics or basic specification analysis.
*   **Knowledge-Based Problem Solving (Core Focus):**
    *   **Deepen KG Integration:** Significantly expand the Knowledge Graph to store richer semantic information about code (structure, dependencies, metrics), ethical policies, security findings, and agent interactions.
    *   **Leverage KG for Agents:** Modify core agents (`CodeReviewAgent`, `TestGenerationAgent`, future `CodeGenerationAgent`) to actively query and utilize the Knowledge Graph for enhanced context, reasoning, and decision-making.
*   **Self-Improving Development Process (Next Automation Target):**
    *   **Automate Initial Prompt:** Implement the automation of the initial prompt construction and submission from the CLI to the Driver LLM API, eliminating the manual copy-paste step.

**Core Workflow Adaptation for Phase 2 Iteration 2:**

For Phase 2 Iteration 2, the core workflow (as detailed in Section II of the full specification) is primarily focused on enhancing the **Validation (Iterative Loop)** stage with more intelligent agents and deeper KG integration, and automating the **Initiation** phase.

1.  **Automated Initiation (New):** The CLI will automate the construction and submission of the initial prompt to the Driver LLM API.
2.  **Autonomous Workflow Execution (Driver LLM Loop - Automated):** The Driver LLM, initiated by the automated prompt, autonomously selects tasks, generates plans, and executes plan steps.
3.  **Enhanced Validation (Orchestrated by Driver):** The Driver orchestrates validation steps using enhanced agents:
    *   **Enhanced Code Quality Checks:** Using an improved `CodeReviewAgent` with semantic analysis.
    *   **Security Scans:** Continuing to use `SecurityAgent` (ZAP).
    *   **Enhanced Test Generation:** Using an improved `TestGenerationAgent` capable of more intelligent test generation.
    *   **Ethical Assessment:** The `EthicalGovernanceEngine` continues to operate, potentially leveraging richer context from the KG.
4.  **Knowledge Graph Interaction:** Agents actively query and update the expanded Knowledge Graph throughout the process, storing semantic code analysis results, test generation strategies, and ethical/security findings.
5.  **Integration:** Validated code is written via `write_file`.
6.  **User Review & Feedback:** User reviews outputs and provides feedback.

*Note: This summary is intended to be a concise and actionable guide for Phase 2 Iteration 2. For full context and long-term vision, please refer to the detailed sections below.*

**Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (Version 1.0): High-Level Specification (Detailed Vision) (AGPLv3 Licensed)**
**Detailed Version (Community-Driven & Passion-Project Focused)**

**Executive Summary:**

The Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (ASGE) is a transformative open-source platform (AGPLv3) designed to revolutionize software development through **ethical actionability, adaptive learning, and human-AI symbiosis.** As a community-driven passion project, it aims for exceptional software quality, efficiency, and ethical responsibility by synergistically combining advanced AI with human expertise. Envisioned for creating robust software, especially for complex, long-context tasks, ASGE prioritizes verifiable reliability, resource efficiency, and transparent ethical operations, aligning with frameworks like the **EU AI Act, GDPR, and COPPA.** **A key aspect of our methodology is an Iterative Grading Process, ensuring continuous quality improvement and verifiable software artifacts. We have successfully completed Phase 1.5, implementing a Markdown-Only Automation Workflow that automates the core Driver LLM loop (task selection, planning, agent invocation, file writing).** This strategic investment in our own development process significantly improves software quality AND accelerates our development cycles for the Metamorphic Ecosystem itself. **We are now focused on Phase 2 Iteration 2: Enhanced Agents & Knowledge Graph**, improving the intelligence of our core AI agents and deepening their integration with the Knowledge Graph. Long-term sustainability is fostered through vibrant community contribution, resourceful operation, and a commitment to open knowledge. This document outlines the core design, architecture, high-level roadmap, technical specifications, and KPIs for Version 1.0.

**I. Foundational Design Principles:**

1.  **Human-AI Symbiosis**: Balancing AI automation with essential human oversight for strategy, nuance, and ethics.
    *   *Mechanism:* AI handles efficiency (code generation, analysis); humans provide strategic direction (specifications, feedback) and ethical judgment (ERB, overrides).
    *   *Oversight:* Ethical Review Board (ERB, 5+ members, quarterly reviews, 3-vote majority for overrides) provides expert governance. User-friendly interfaces (web UI planned) enable stakeholder interaction. Open contribution processes manage community input.

2.  **Ethical Actionability**: Embedding demonstrable and enforceable ethics into every component.
    *   *Mechanism:* Ethics integrated by design. The **`EthicalGovernanceEngine`** uses configurable JSON policies (aligned with EU AI Act, GDPR, COPPA) to enforce constraints during validation. Policies are version-controlled and community-vetted. Monthly audits by ERB ensure accountability.
    *   *Modules:* Proactive **Bias Detection & Mitigation Module** analyzes code/outputs. **Transparency & Explainability Module** (planned) will provide APIs to retrieve justification for policy violations or agent decisions, potentially querying LLM logs or KG links. Clear Human Override pathways exist via the ERB interface (planned). Continuous AI self-assessment against policies generates compliance reports.

3.  **Adaptive Learning Fabric**: Intelligently designed for continuous improvement.
    *   *Mechanism:* Data-driven adaptation using performance metrics (KPIs), agent feedback (e.g., code review results), and user input.
    *   *Modules:* **Continuous Learning & Adaptation Core** uses ML techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from agent feedback, A/B testing of generation strategies) to enhance agent performance and ethical alignment. **Self-Monitoring & Adaptive Healing Subsystem** uses health checks (API latency, resource usage) and error logs to trigger automated recovery procedures (e.g., restarting agents, rolling back configurations). **Predictive Risk Assessment Module** uses historical data and modeling (e.g., `QuantumRiskPredictor`) to forecast potential issues.

4.  **Cyber-Physical Resilience & Resource Efficiency**: Prioritizing security, robustness, and sustainability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Formal verification (**Coq** proofs compiled in CI for core logic like boundary detection; **Isabelle/HOL** planned for critical algorithms) provides mathematical guarantees. Strategic use of memory-safe **Rust** for safety-critical modules (e.g., verification components, policy engine core) and high-performance **Go** for concurrent agents (e.g., API handlers, parallel analysis tasks). Proactive error handling (e.g., retries, graceful degradation) built into agents and orchestration. Core focus on resource optimization (caching, efficient algorithms, potential serverless components).
    *   *Targets:* 25% resource reduction, 40% performance improvement (12 months post-Phase 2 completion).

5.  **Knowledge-Based Problem Solving**: Leveraging and evolving knowledge for advanced software genesis.
    *   *Mechanism:* The **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG)** acts as the central "memory," storing semantic representations of code, specifications, ethical rules, security findings, performance data, and community feedback. The **Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer** queries the KG for relevant context before prompting LLMs (Gemini, Hugging Face, others planned). It manages long contexts using techniques like **semantic chunking** (`SemanticChunker`) and **recursive summarization** (`RecursiveSummarizer`). It routes tasks to appropriate LLMs based on capability/cost and handles API failover. Specialized **AI Agents** query the KG and LLM Orchestrator to perform their tasks (analysis, generation, review).

6.  **Open Innovation & Global Accessibility**: Fostering a vibrant community and broad usability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Actively manage community contributions via **GitHub** (primary repository). Adhere to open standards (OpenAPI for APIs) and prioritize FOSS tools (Python, Go, Rust, Coq, ZAP, etc.).
        *   **AI-Augmented Project Planning:** Integrate AI-driven iterative roadmap refinement, inspired by the process used to develop MSGE itself. This includes AI-assisted risk assessment, task breakdown, and continuous plan optimization, aiming to minimize uncertainty and maximize project success probability. **The completion of the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow" in Phase 1.5 provides a foundational step towards this, demonstrating our commitment to self-improvement and efficient, transparent workflows by automating the core Driver LLM execution loop.**
    *   *Future:* Develop a **Community Contribution Platform** (web UI). Implement localization (10+ languages). Support diverse open-source LLMs (Alpa, StarCoder) to reduce vendor lock-in and improve global accessibility.

```

*   **Core Workflow Example (Post-Phase 1.5 Stage 3):**
    1.  User initiates the autonomous workflow (currently via CLI + manual prompt submission to Driver LLM API).
    2.  The **Driver LLM** (within `Metamorphic Core`) receives the prompt, loads the `ROADMAP.json`, and enters its `autonomous_loop()`.
    3.  The Driver autonomously selects the next task with status "Not Started".
    4.  The Driver generates a step-by-step solution plan for the selected task (orchestrating LLM calls via `LLMOrchestrator`).
    5.  The Driver iterates through the plan steps.
    6.  For steps requiring code generation, the Driver automatically invokes the **Coder LLM** (via `LLMOrchestrator`) with a specific prompt for that step.
    7.  For steps requiring file operations, the Driver automatically uses the `write_file` or `list_files` tools.
    8.  The Driver orchestrates validation steps as part of the plan execution:
        *   Code Quality (`CodeReviewAgent` - Flake8).
        *   Security Scans (`SecurityAgent` - ZAP).
        *   Testing (`TestGenAgent` - placeholder/basic).
        *   Ethical Assessment (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`).
    9.  Results (Flake8 output, ethical status, generated tests, security findings) are processed and potentially stored in the KG.
    10. The Driver logs the progress and results of the iteration, including a Grade Report.
    11. The Driver repeats the loop (steps 3-10) until no "Not Started" tasks remain in the roadmap.
    12. **(Iterative Grading & Refinement):** The user reviews the outputs of the autonomous iteration (generated code, reports, logs). A reviewer assesses the changes across multiple quality dimensions, including **code style, ethical compliance, test success probability, non-regression probability, and security soundness**, and assigns a probability-based grade with actionable feedback. This feedback guides the user's next interaction with the Driver LLM to refine the generated artifacts and update the roadmap status manually (until roadmap automation is implemented).

        *(For full details on the grading process, see [**ROADMAP.md - Development Process & Methodology**](ROADMAP.md#development-process---methodology)).*

        **(Parallel/Async - Future Enhancements):**
        *   *(Phase 2 Iteration 2+) Enhanced agents perform more sophisticated analysis and generation.*
        *   *(Phase 2 Iteration 2+) Deeper KG integration provides richer context for agents.*
        *   *(Phase 3) `FormalVerificationEngine` could trigger Coq proofs for critical logic paths, results feeding into validation.*
        *   *(Phase 4) `PerformanceAnalysisAgent` could run benchmarks and profiling, results informing resource optimization.*

    * **With the completion of Phase 1.5 Stage 3, the Metamorphic Core now directly orchestrates the Coder LLM and file operations, automating the core development loop. The primary remaining manual step for the user is the initial construction and submission of the comprehensive prompt to the Driver LLM API endpoint. Automating this step is a key task in Phase 2 Iteration 2.**

*   **Key Components (Detailed):**
    *   **Human Input & Oversight Interface:** (Planned Web UI) Secure portal for spec submission (text, later diagrams), configuration, feedback, ethical guidance input, ERB overrides, progress dashboards.
    *   **Metamorphic Core (Adaptive AI Orchestration):**
        *   *Dynamic Knowledge Graph:* Neo4j or similar graph DB storing nodes (code chunks, specs, policies, vulnerabilities, tests, metrics) and semantic relationships. Enables complex querying for context retrieval and pattern analysis. **Phase 2 Iteration 2 focuses on expanding the KG schema to store richer code semantics.**
        *   *Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer:* Manages API calls to multiple LLMs (Gemini, HF models via `InferenceClient`, potentially OpenAI). Implements context window management (semantic chunking, summarization), cost/latency optimization (model selection based on task complexity), robust retries, and failover logic. Uses `TokenAllocator` for budget management. **This layer is now orchestrated by the autonomous Driver LLM.**
        *   *Modular AI Agent Network:*
            *   `SpecificationAnalysisAgent`: Parses natural language/structured input into formal requirements, potentially using AST analysis and LLMs.

            *   `CodeReviewAgent`: Runs static analysis with **Flake8** for code quality. **Integrated into `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint. Phase 2 Iteration 2 focuses on enhancing this agent with semantic analysis.** (Post-MVP: Bandit, Semgrep for security SAST; LLMs for deeper semantic review).
            *   `SecurityAgent`: Orchestrates security tools (ZAP DAST now; SAST via Bandit/Semgrep later). Analyzes results, stores findings in KG.
            *   `PerformanceAnalysisAgent`: (Post-MVP) Integrates profiling tools (cProfile) and analyzes performance metrics.
            *   `FormalVerificationEngine`: Interfaces with Coq/Isabelle/Z3 to run proofs against code or specifications.
            *   `PredictiveRiskAssessmentModule`: Uses `QuantumRiskPredictor` (trained on historical KG data) to forecast ethical/security risks.
            *   `SelfMonitoringAndAdaptiveHealing`: Monitors system metrics (Prometheus), logs errors, triggers recovery actions.
            *   `ResourceManagementOptimization`: (Post-MVP) Optimizes cloud resource usage, potentially using Kubernetes HPA based on Prometheus metrics.
    *   **Ethical Governance Framework:**
        *   **Project Process Ethics:** Extend the Ethical Governance Framework to evaluate and guide MSGE's own development processes, ensuring they align with ethical principles of **transparency, risk mitigation, and continuous improvement**. This includes using AI-driven roadmap refinement to minimize uncertainty and enhance project success probability, and proactively addressing potential ethical concerns within the development process itself. **Furthermore, to ensure consistent ethical considerations in code contributions, we employ an **Iterative Grading Process** (detailed in [ROADMAP.md - Development Process & Methodology](ROADMAP.md#development-process---methodology)) that includes "Ethical Policy Compliance Probability", "Code Style Compliance Probability", and other key quality metrics in code reviews and iterative refinement cycles.**
         *   *EthicalPolicyEngine (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`):* Loads JSON policies (`jsonschema` validation). `enforce_policy` method checks code/metadata against loaded constraints (regex, keyword checks, **AST analysis for transparency**). Returns compliance status.
         *   *BiasDetectionMitigationModule:* Uses NLP libraries (spaCy, Transformers) or fairness toolkits (Fairlearn) to analyze text (comments, docs) and potentially code structure for bias indicators. (Post-MVP) Implements mitigation strategies (e.g., suggesting alternative phrasing).
         *   *TransparencyExplainabilityModule:* (Planned) Provides API endpoints to retrieve justification for policy violations or agent decisions, potentially querying LLM logs or KG links.
    *   **Formal Verification & Resilience Subsystem:**
        *   *FormalVerificationEngine:* Interfaces with Coq (proofs compiled in CI), Isabelle/HOL, and Z3 (SMT solver) for multi-layered verification.
        *   *QuantumStatePreserver:* (MVP placeholder) Saves quantum states for auditability.
