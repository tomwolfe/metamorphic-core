**Version âˆž: An Ever-Evolving Framework for Software Excellence**

## Project Overview

The Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem is a transformative initiative aimed at revolutionizing software development through an AI-driven, self-refining framework. This ecosystem is designed to generate, maintain, and evolve high-quality, ethical, and secure software solutions, operating as a perpetual engine of innovation and improvement.

### Key Objectives:

- **Autonomous Software Development:** Empower the system to independently create complete software applications from high-level specifications.
- **Ethical Development Assurance:** Integrate robust ethical governance to ensure compliance with defined principles throughout the development process.
- **Continuous Quality Assurance:** Automate testing, code review, and security analysis to maintain exceptional standards.
- **Self-Enhancement:** Enable the ecosystem to learn, adapt, and improve its capabilities through user feedback and evolving best practices.

## Envisioned Workflow: From Concept to Code

The long-term vision for the Metamorphic Ecosystem is a streamlined workflow from high-level specifications to fully realized software. Here's a concise overview of the process:

1. **User Input:** Provide a high-level description of the desired software, either in natural language or structurally via a future cloud interface.

2. **Specification Refinement (AI-Powered):** AI agents, directed by Large Language Models (LLMs), analyze and enhance the input, clarifying ambiguities and identifying potential issues.

3. **Design & Planning (AI-Driven):** Generate a comprehensive software architecture and development roadmap based on the refined specifications.

4. **Code Generation (AI Agents):** Automatically produce code across multiple languages, adhering to best practices and architectural guidelines.

5. **Testing & Validation (Multi-Agent System):** Conduct thorough testing, including:
    - Test suite generation (unit, integration, etc.)
    - Code quality and bug analysis
    - Ethical compliance assessment
    - Security vulnerability scans

6. **Continuous Integration & Quality Assurance (CI/CD Integration):** Integrate seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent monitoring of quality, security, and ethical standards.

7. **Self-Improvement & Adaptation (Autonomous Learning):** Continuously evolve the system's capabilities through learning and adaptation.

## Current Status

The ecosystem is actively under development, with a focus on foundational components:
- **Ethical Validation Framework:** Mechanisms for enforcing and auditing ethical policies.
- **Code Analysis Agents:** Tools for static analysis, test generation, and quality assessment.
- **LLM Orchestration Layer:** Infrastructure for managing interactions with various LLMs.
- **Knowledge Graph:** A repository for ethical principles, analysis data, and system knowledge.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automation for quality assurance processes.

**Note:** While the system is not yet capable of fully autonomous software generation, it currently functions as an advanced AI-powered code analysis and ethical validation framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (optional for services like Redis)
- **Google Gemini API Key:** Obtain from [Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/).
- **Optional:** Hugging Face and GitHub API keys for extended functionality.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomwolfe/metamorphic-core.git
   cd metamorphic-core

2. Set Up Environment Variables:

  Copy .env.example to .env:
  cp .env.example .env
  Modify .env to include your API keys:
  LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_key_here (optional)
  YOUR_GITHUB_API_KEY=your_token_here (optional)
3. Start Redis (optional for rate limiting):

  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml.example up -d redis
4. Set Up Virtual Environment (recommended):

  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/macOS)
  venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
  
5. Install Dependencies:

  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements/base.txt
  pip install -r requirements/dev.txt  # For development tools

Running the API Server

cd src/api
python server.py
The API server will be available at http://0.0.0.0:5000/.

API Endpoints (Examples)

Current Functionality:

/generate (GET): Check system status.

curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/generate
/ethical/analyze (POST): Analyze code for ethical considerations.

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"code": "print(\"Hello, Ethical World!\")"}' http://0.0.0.0:5000/ethical/analyze
/ethical/solve-math (POST): Test mathematical problem-solving.

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"problem": "What is 2 + 2?"}' http://0.0.0.0:5000/ethical/solve-math
/ethical/audit/{state_id} (GET): Retrieve audit trail data.

curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/ethical/audit/QSTATE_EXAMPLE
/ethical/visualize/{state_id} (GET): Obtain visualization data.

curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/ethical/visualize/QSTATE_EXAMPLE
Note: These endpoints are currently basic and under active development.

Roadmap

The development is structured in progressive stages:

Stage 1 (Foundation): Core components like LLM orchestration, knowledge graph, and security scanning. (In progress)
Stage 2 (Agent Integration): Implement AI agent pipelines for specification analysis and testing.
Stage 3 (Ethical Core): Develop the ethical policy engine and transparency features.
Stage 4 (CI Integration): Integrate CI/CD quality gates.
Stage 5 (Self-Improvement): Enable autonomous refinement and monitoring.
The ultimate goal is full autonomous software generation while maintaining ethical and quality standards.
