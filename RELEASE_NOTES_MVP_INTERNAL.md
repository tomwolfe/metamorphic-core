**Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem - Phase 1 MVP Internal Release (v0.1.0-internal-mvp)**

**1. Introduction / Purpose of this Release**

This document outlines the details for the Phase 1 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Internal Release of the Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem (MSGE).

This release is specifically intended for:

*   **Internal testing and feedback** from the core development team and select early testers.
*   **Validating the core architecture** of the MSGE framework and its foundational components.
*   **Evaluating the functionality of the Ethical Governance Engine** and its JSON-configurable policy enforcement.
*   **Assessing the integration of the Code Quality Analysis API (Flake8)** within the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` endpoint.

Your feedback on this MVP is crucial for guiding further development and ensuring we are building a robust and valuable ecosystem.  Please carefully review the features outlined below and follow the "Getting Started" instructions to begin testing.

**2. Key Features & MVP Highlights**

This Phase 1 MVP Internal Release includes the following key features:

*   **Code Analysis**: Static analysis with **Flake8** via API (`CodeReviewAgent`). **Integrated into `/genesis/analyze-ethical`. Flake8 code quality analysis is now fully integrated and verified with passing integration tests.**
*   **Security Scanning**: Automated DAST via OWASP ZAP integration is **actively running in the CI pipeline** using GitHub Actions, providing baseline security checks for each code change.  **Note:** For this MVP internal release, the ZAP service in `docker-compose.yml` has a known issue and may not function as expected locally.  Please rely on the CI pipeline for verified security scan results during this MVP phase.
*   **Ethical Assessment**: **JSON-configurable** rule-based engine (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`) capable of dynamic enforcement based on loaded policies. **API integration tested and refined.**
*   **LLM Powered Features**: Core functionalities leverage Google Gemini and Hugging Face via `LLMOrchestrator`.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fully automated via GitHub Actions (tests, security scans, builds).
*   **Knowledge Graph Backbone**: Operational KG for system knowledge (basic usage).
*   **Test Generation (Placeholder):** `TestGenAgent` generates placeholder pytest code.
*   **API Endpoint (`/genesis/analyze-ethical`):** Core functionality (Ethics + **Flake8 Quality**) integrated and verified through integration tests. Error handling refined.

**3. Known Issues and Limitations (MVP Scope) - Updated**

This Phase 1 MVP Internal Release has the following known issues and limitations:

*   **ZAP Service (docker-compose.yml) Issue:** The ZAP service defined in `docker-compose.yml` may exit unexpectedly after startup and is **not reliably functional locally in this MVP release.**  Local ZAP-based security scans using `docker-compose up` are not currently reliable. **For security vulnerability assessment in this MVP, please rely on the automated ZAP Baseline Scan reports available in the CI pipeline runs for each Pull Request and Push to the `main` branch.** Resolution of the local ZAP service issue is planned for a future release (post-MVP).
*   **Placeholder Test Generation:** The `TestGenAgent` currently generates placeholder pytest tests only. These generated tests are intended as a basic integration point and **do not provide meaningful test coverage** for the generated code. Enhanced and intelligent test generation is planned for future iterations.
*   **Limited API Endpoints:**  This MVP release focuses primarily on the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint, which integrates the core ethical analysis and code quality checking functionalities.  The `/genesis/health` and `/genesis/solve-math` endpoints are included for basic testing and verification purposes. **Other API endpoints outlined in the roadmap are placeholders or are not yet implemented in this MVP.**
*   **Performance:**  Performance optimization is an ongoing effort.  You may observe **latency, especially when using LLM-powered features** (like code analysis involving LLM calls). Performance will be a key focus for future optimization iterations.  **Note:** Code quality analysis via Flake8, however, is designed for efficiency and should provide relatively fast feedback in most cases.
*   **Documentation (In-Progress):** While the `README.md` provides essential getting started information and API endpoint details, **detailed API documentation and comprehensive contribution guidelines are still under development** and will be provided in subsequent releases.

**Important Note:** This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release, focused on validating the core architecture and key functionalities.  Many features and refinements are planned for future iterations. Your feedback is essential to help us prioritize and shape the roadmap for continued development.

**4. Getting Started - Quickstart for Internal Testers**

To quickly get started with testing the MVP, please follow these steps:

*   **Prerequisites & Installation:**
    *   Refer to the "**Getting Started**" -> "**Prerequisites**" and "**Installation**" sections in the main `README.md` for detailed instructions.
    *   Ensure you have **Python 3.11+**, **Docker** (optional, for Redis/ZAP), **Git**, and obtain the necessary **API keys** (especially **Gemini API Key**) as outlined in the README.
    *   We recommend setting up a Python virtual environment (`venv`) as described in the README to isolate project dependencies.

*   **Running the API Server:**
    *   Follow the "**Running the API Server**" instructions in the `README.md` to start the Flask API server.
    *   **Important:** Ensure your `.env` file is configured correctly with your API keys before starting the server.
    *   Run the server using:

        ```bash
        python src/api/server.py
        ```

    *   The server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

*   **Testing the Core Endpoint - `/genesis/analyze-ethical`:**
    *   Use the "**Quickstart Guide**" and "**Sample MVP Request/Response**" examples provided in the `README.md` to test the core `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint.
    *   You can use `curl`, Postman, or similar tools to send POST requests to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/genesis/analyze-ethical`.
    *   Focus on examining the API response, particularly the `"code_quality"` and `"ethical_analysis"` sections.
    *   Experiment with different Python code snippets (compliant and non-compliant code) to observe the API's behavior and policy enforcement.
    *   (Optional) Test different ethical policies by specifying the `policy_name` parameter in the request body (e.g., `"policy_safety_moderate"`, `"policy_transparency_minimum"`). Refer to the policy files in the `policies/` directory for available policy names.

**Note:** For detailed information on system requirements, API keys, and advanced usage, please consult the full `README.md` document. This "Quickstart" section is intended to get you testing the core MVP functionality as quickly as possible.
