# Contributing to the Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem <a name="contributing"></a>

We enthusiastically welcome contributions to the Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem! Whether you are interested in core development, ethical policy design, security enhancements, documentation, or community engagement, your contributions are valuable.

**Contribution Areas:**

1.  **Core Code Development:**
    *   Enhance existing AI agents (e.g., `CodeGenerationAgent`, `TestGenerationAgent`, `SecurityAgent`).
    *   Implement new agents or sub-modules (e.g., for formal verification, quantum computing integration, UI/UX).
    *   Improve core framework components (e.g., Knowledge Graph, LLM Orchestration, Ethical Governance Engine).
    *   Optimize performance, security, and resource efficiency.

2.  **Ethical Governance & Policy:**
    *   Design and propose new ethical policies (JSON format) for various domains and risk levels.
    *   Contribute to the Ethical Policy Schema (`ethical_policy_schema.json`).
    *   Develop bias detection and mitigation strategies.
    *   Enhance transparency and explainability features.

3.  **Security Enhancements:**
    *   Develop new security agents or security checks (SAST, DAST, etc.).
    *   Contribute to security best practices and guidelines.
    *   Help identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Improve and expand existing documentation (API docs, specifications, roadmaps, tutorials).
    *   Create new documentation (e.g., examples, use cases, architectural diagrams).
    *   Translate documentation into other languages (localization).

5.  **Community Engagement & Support:**
    *   Help answer questions and provide support to other community members.
    *   Share your use cases and experiences with the Metamorphic Ecosystem.
    *   Contribute to community forums, discussions, and events (planned).
    *   Help with community building and outreach.

**Contribution Guidelines:**

1.  **Review the Roadmap & Specification:** Familiarize yourself with the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) to understand the project's direction and goals.
2.  **Check for Existing Issues:** Before starting significant work, check the [issue tracker](link-to-github-issues) for existing issues related to your intended contribution. Comment on an existing issue or create a new one to discuss your plans and get feedback.
3.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the `metamorphic-core` repository to your GitHub account.
4.  **Create a Branch:** Create a dedicated branch for your contribution (e.g., `feature/new-test-agent` or `fix/bug-in-llm-orch`).
5.  **Code Style & Quality:**
    *   Follow Python coding conventions (PEP 8).
    *   Write clear, well-commented code.
    *   Include unit and integration tests for new features and bug fixes.
    *   Ensure code is Flake8 compliant (run `flake8` locally).
    *   Use pre-commit hooks (recommended - see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)).
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Once your contribution is ready, submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the `metamorphic-core` repository.
    *   Clearly describe the purpose and scope of your contribution in the PR description.
    *   Reference any related issues in the PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Implements feature requested in #456").
7.  **Code Review & Iteration:**
    *   Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers using an **Iterative Grading Process** (see [ROADMAP.md - Development Process & Methodology](ROADMAP.md#development-process---methodology)).
    *   Be responsive to feedback and be prepared to iterate on your contribution to address review comments and improve code quality.
    *   Code review is focused on code quality, correctness, security, ethical considerations, and alignment with project goals, as evaluated through the **Iterative Grading Process**.

### Contribution Review Process: Iterative Probability-Based Grading

To maintain the high quality standards of the Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem, we use an iterative review process for all contributions, based on **Multi-Dimensional Grading**.  When you submit a contribution, it will be evaluated using this process, which involves:

*   **Multi-Dimensional Quality and Risk Assessment:** Your contribution will be rigorously assessed across multiple quality dimensions: Probability of Non-Regression, Probability of Test Success, Code Style Compliance Probability, Ethical Policy Compliance Probability, and Probability of Security Soundness.
*   **Probability Percentage Grades & Feedback:** For each dimension, a probability percentage grade will be assigned, reflecting the estimated confidence in that aspect of the contribution. You will receive an **Iterative Grading Report** with:
    *   **Overall Percentage Grade:** A combined grade reflecting overall quality and confidence.
    *   **Dimension-Specific Probability Percentages:** Individual percentage grades for each quality dimension (Non-Regression, Test Success, Code Style, Ethics, Security).
    *   **Actionable Feedback:** Detailed feedback for each dimension, explaining the rationale behind the grades and providing concrete steps for improvement.
*   **Iterative Improvement:**  We encourage you to use this feedback to refine your contribution and resubmit for review.  The goal is to work iteratively, using the feedback to increase the probability percentages across all dimensions and achieve a 100% overall grade.  This collaborative process ensures that all contributions meet our rigorous quality benchmarks and contribute to a robust and reliable system.

By understanding and participating in this Iterative Grading Process, you directly contribute to the high standards of the Metamorphic project.
