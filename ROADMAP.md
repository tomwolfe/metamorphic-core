## Roadmap: Phase 1.5 - Workflow Automation Side Project (Weeks 7-8) ðŸš€

**Iteration Goal:** Implement Level 1 and Level 2 of the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow" to enhance development efficiency for Phase 2 and beyond.

**Success Metrics for Phase 1.5:**
*   Level 1 Documentation Complete: âœ… COMPLETE: `docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md` file created and populated with detailed documentation of the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow," including the "Ideal Self-Driving Prompt" and usage guide. (Week 7)
*   Level 2 Workflow Driver Component Partially Implemented: `src/core/automation/workflow_driver.py` component partially implemented, including core functionalities for prompt generation, LLM interaction, basic output parsing, and a command-line interface in `run_genesis.py`. (Week 8)
*   Basic Workflow Driver Tests Implemented: Some unit tests exist for `WorkflowDriver`.
*   Command-Line Interface and `list_files` method - INCOMPLETE: `run_genesis.py` is not yet created and `list_files` method is still empty.

**Phase 1.5 Focus (Weeks 7-8):**

        *   **Entry Criteria:** `docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md` is complete. Basic project structure is set up.
        *   **Success Criteria:** `workflow_driver.py` contains a `WorkflowDriver` class with the following methods:
            *   `__init__(self)`: Initializes the class (can be empty).
            *   `load_roadmap(self, roadmap_path: str)`: Reads and parses `ROADMAP.md` into a usable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries). **IMPLEMENTED - HARDCODED OUTPUT**
            *    Implements basic file loading, using only safe libraries.
            *  Includes the `list_files` command. **NOT IMPLEMENTED - EMPTY METHOD**
            *   `__repr__(self)` - This will ensure easier output for logging to ensure that the models read the data correctly.

        *   **Success Criteria:** `run_genesis.py` can:
            *   Instantiate `WorkflowDriver`.
            *   Call `load_roadmap` and display the parsed task list in a human-readable format.
            * Has `list_files` functionality (calls and prints results).
            * Has appropriate doc strings.
        *   **Expected Grade Outcome:** 0%.
   * **Task 2.3 (Week 8 - 1 day):**

            * Sub-task 2: Implement logging to aid debugging.
            * Sub-task 3: Add basic error handling for potential exceptions.
            * Sub-task 4:  Add tests for file reading functionality
        * **Expected Grade Outcome:** 40% (Some tests implemented for hardcoded output; file i/o not yet tested).
