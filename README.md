**ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT FOCUS: PHASE 2 Iteration 2 - Enhanced Agents & Knowledge Graph ðŸ§ **

Phase 1 MVP is complete, Phase 1.5: Workflow Automation is complete, and **Phase 1.6: Enhanced Workflow Automation is now also complete!** We successfully implemented the end-to-end automation layer, automating workflow initiation, validation execution, feedback processing, and roadmap status updates. This establishes a robust, self-driving development loop. We are now transitioning into **Phase 2 Iteration 2**, focusing on significantly enhancing core AI agents (Test Generation, Code Review) with deeper code understanding and integrating them with an expanded Knowledge Graph for improved context management and generation quality. See the [Roadmap](#further-documentation) for details.

---

**Strategic Impact of Phase 1.6:**

Phase 1.6 focused on completing the end-to-end automation layer by automating workflow initiation, validation execution, feedback processing, and roadmap status updates. **With the successful completion of Phase 1.6, we have established a robust, self-driving development loop that significantly accelerates iteration cycles and improves the consistency and reliability of the development process.** This strategic investment in our own development process is crucial before proceeding to Phase 2's focus on enhancing agent intelligence and Knowledge Graph integration. This also supports more robust and reliable AI-driven code generation and validation by ensuring automated feedback loops are closed.

**Three-Stage Approach to Markdown-Only Automation (Completed in Phase 1.5 & 1.6):**

Phase 1.5 established the fundamental markdown automation workflow and CLI driver, achieving autonomous execution of development tasks (task selection, planning, agent invocation, file writing) once initiated. **Phase 1.6 built upon this by automating the initiation via CLI/API, integrating automated execution of validation steps (tests, code review, security), parsing the Grade Report, and automatically updating the roadmap status.** The workflow is now fully automated from initial CLI command through validation and roadmap update.

**Estimated Potential Benefits (Long-Term, Full Integration):**

*   **MSGE (Without Phase 1.5/1.6):** Represents a baseline system with manual operations and loosely coupled components, delivering a starting-point project success likelihood of 65%.
*   **Phase 1.5 (Completed):** Successfully automated key routine workflow operations (task processing, agent invocation, file writing), improving developer experience by an estimated 85% in those specific tasks once fully integrated.
*   **Phase 1.6 (Completed):** Completed the end-to-end automation loop (initiation, validation execution, reporting, status update), significantly enhancing the overall efficiency, consistency, and reliability of the autonomous development process. This is estimated to contribute a further 10-15% improvement in overall developer efficiency and project success likelihood compared to Phase 1.5 alone.
*   **MSGE (With Phase 1.6):** The long-term objective is a fully integrated system achieving up to a 95% grade in overall developer efficiency. Faster iteration cycles and more consistent code quality are expected. Successful execution of the Markdown-Only Automation Workflow is intended to enhance adherence to evolving ethical standards.

### <a name="quickstart-guide-to-markdown-only-automation"></a>Quickstart Guide to Markdown-Only Automation

For a streamlined, AI-driven development experience, you can use the **"Markdown-Only Automation" workflow**. This workflow leverages the "Ideal Self-Driving Prompt" and augmented `.md` documentation to guide an LLM to autonomously drive development tasks. **With the successful completion of Phase 1.5 Stage 3, the core Driver LLM loop is now automated, including task selection, solution planning, automated Coder LLM invocation, automated `write_file` tool execution, and iterative processing of plan steps.** **With the completion of Phase 1.6, the entire loop from initiation via CLI/API through validation execution, grade report parsing, and roadmap status updates is automated.**

**(As of Phase 1.6, the manual step of constructing and submitting the initial comprehensive prompt to the Driver LLM API endpoint is automated via the CLI. The Workflow Driver, initiated by the API call, now autonomously selects tasks, generates plans, invokes agents (including the Coder LLM for code generation), writes files, runs validation (tests, code review, security), generates a Grade Report, and updates the roadmap status.)**

**Quickstart Steps (Post-Phase 1.6):**

1.  **Ensure the API server is running** (`python src/api/server.py`). This server now hosts the `/genesis/drive_workflow` endpoint. Keep this terminal window open.
2.  Prepare your `ROADMAP.json` and codebase text as described in the [Full Guide](docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md). The roadmap is now managed in `ROADMAP.json`, not `ROADMAP.md`. Ensure `ROADMAP.json` contains tasks with status "Not Started".
3.  Open your terminal in the `metamorphic-core` project directory.
4.  **Run the CLI to initiate the automated workflow:**

    ```bash
    python src/cli/main.py
    ```
    (You can optionally specify a different roadmap file or output directory using `--roadmap` and `--output-dir` arguments as described in the [Full Markdown-Only Automation Workflow Guide](docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md#cli-integration-and-execution)).
5.  **Monitor the API server logs.** The Driver LLM (running within the API process, triggered by the CLI) will now autonomously:
    *   Select the next task with status "Not Started" from `ROADMAP.json`.
    *   Generate a solution plan.
    *   Execute plan steps, including invoking the Coder LLM, reading/writing files, and triggering automated validation.
    *   **Automatically execute tests (`pytest`).**
    *   **Automatically execute code review (`CodeReviewAgent`) and security checks (`SecurityAgent`).**
    *   Generate a Grade Report based on validation results.
    *   **Parse the Grade Report and determine the outcome.**
    *   **Automatically update the task status in `ROADMAP.json`** based on the evaluation (e.g., "Completed", "Blocked").
6.  **Review the outputs:** After the autonomous loop iteration completes (indicated by logs), check the updated `ROADMAP.json`, any generated/modified code files, and the API server logs for the detailed Grade Report and workflow status. Address any tasks marked "Blocked" or issues highlighted in the report manually before initiating the workflow again.

**Example Quickstart Scenario (Post-Phase 1.6):**

Let's assume you want to work on the first 'Not Started' task from your `ROADMAP.json`.

1.  **Ensure the API server is running:**
    ```bash
    python src/api/server.py
    ```
    (In a separate terminal)
2.  **Open a terminal** in your `metamorphic-core` project directory.
3.  **Run the CLI:**

    ```bash
    python src/cli/main.py
    ```

4.  **Review the API server logs.** The logs will show the `WorkflowDriver` starting, selecting the next 'Not Started' task, generating a plan, executing steps (which might involve generating code and writing it), automatically running tests/reviews, and finally updating the status of the task in `ROADMAP.json`.
5.  **Check the updated `ROADMAP.json`** to see the status of the task.
6.  **Review any generated code** (e.g., in `src/api/routes/`) and the logs for details on the execution and Grade Report.

**For detailed instructions and the structure of the "Ideal Self-Driving Prompt" (which is now constructed automatically by the CLI), please refer to the [Full Markdown-Only Automation Workflow Guide](docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md).** Note that the `ROADMAP.md` file is now autogenerated from `ROADMAP.json`.

## <a name="workflow-use-case-example"></a>Workflow and Use Case Example

The Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem aims to automate software development from specification to deployment. Consider generating software for an **Autonomous Drone Package Delivery System**. This example showcases the framework's ability to handle complexity, security, ethics, and hardware interaction.

**Conceptual Workflow (Post-Phase 1.6):**

1.  **Input:** User initiates the automated workflow via the CLI (`python src/cli/main.py`). The CLI automatically gathers context (specs, policies, documentation) and submits it to the Driver LLM API.
2.  **Autonomous Workflow Execution (Driver LLM Loop - Automated):** The Driver LLM, initiated by the automated prompt via the API, autonomously:
    *   Selects the next task from `ROADMAP.json`.
    *   Generates a step-by-step solution plan for the task.
    *   Iterates through the plan steps, automatically invoking relevant agents (like the Coder LLM) and tools (like `write_file`) as needed by the plan.
3.  **Automated Validation (Iterative Loop - Orchestrated by Driver):** The Driver orchestrates and *automatically executes* validation steps as part of the plan execution. This includes:
    *   Code Quality (`CodeReviewAgent` - Flake8, Bandit).
    *   Security Scans (`SecurityAgent` - ZAP).
    *   Testing (`TestGenAgent` - placeholder/basic, *automatically run via pytest*).
    *   Ethical Assessment (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`).
    *   Formal Verification (`FormalVerificationEngine` - future).
    *   Validation results are captured, logged, and feed into the Grade Report.
4.  **Automated Feedback & Roadmap Update:** The Driver automatically parses the Grade Report, determines the outcome based on predefined criteria (e.g., test pass rate, severity of issues), and *automatically updates the task status in `ROADMAP.json`*.
5.  **Integration:** Validated code is written to the filesystem via the `write_file` tool, orchestrated by the Driver.
6.  **Improvement:** `ContinuousLearningCore` analyzes performance and feedback to refine agents and processes (future).
7.  **User Review:** The user reviews the outputs of the autonomous iteration (generated code, updated roadmap, reports, logs) to monitor progress and intervene if necessary (e.g., if a task is marked 'Blocked').

    *(For full details on the grading process, see [**CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution Review Process: Iterative Probability-Based Grading**](CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-review-process-iterative-probability-based-grading)).*

    **With the completion of Phase 1.6, the Metamorphic Core now orchestrates the entire development iteration autonomously, from initiation via CLI/API through validation execution, grade report parsing, and roadmap status updates. The user's role shifts from manual step execution to initiating the loop and reviewing the results.**

*   **Key Components (Detailed):**
    *   **Human Input & Oversight Interface:** (Planned Web UI) Secure portal for spec submission (text, later diagrams), configuration, feedback, ethical guidance input, ERB overrides, progress dashboards. The CLI (`src/cli/main.py`) now serves as the primary *initiation* interface for the automated workflow. **This CLI now calls the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint to trigger the autonomous loop.**
    *   **Metamorphic Core (Adaptive AI Orchestration):**
        *   *Dynamic Knowledge Graph:* Neo4j or similar graph DB storing nodes (code chunks, specs, policies, vulnerabilities, tests, metrics) and semantic relationships. Enables complex querying for context retrieval and pattern analysis. (Phase 2 Iteration 2 focuses on expanding the KG schema to store richer code semantics).
        *   *Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer:* Manages API calls to multiple LLMs (Gemini, Hugging Face, potentially OpenAI). Implements context window management (semantic chunking, summarization), cost/latency optimization (model selection based on task complexity), robust retries, and failover logic. Uses `TokenAllocator` for budget management. **This layer is now orchestrated by the autonomous Driver LLM, triggered via the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint.**
        *   *Modular AI Agent Network:*
            *   `SpecificationAnalysisAgent`: Parses natural language/structured input into formal requirements, potentially using AST analysis and LLMs.
            *   `TestGenerationAgent`: Generates pytest tests (placeholders in MVP, meaningful tests including HIL using code/spec analysis later). **Automated execution of these tests is now part of the Phase 1.6 workflow.** (Phase 2 Iteration 2 focuses on enhancing this agent for more intelligent test generation).
            *   `CodeGenerationAgent`: (Post-MVP) Generates code (Python, Go, Rust, JS/TS, C++) based on specs from KG/LLM Orchestrator.
            *   `CodeReviewAgent`: Runs static analysis with **Flake8** for code quality. **Integrated into `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint. Automated execution is now part of the Phase 1.6 workflow.** (Phase 2 Iteration 2 focuses on enhancing this agent with semantic analysis). (Post-MVP: Bandit, Semgrep for security SAST; LLMs for deeper semantic review).
            *   `SecurityAgent`: Orchestrates security tools (ZAP DAST now; SAST via Bandit/Semgrep later). Analyzes results, stores findings in KG. **Automated execution of relevant checks is now part of the Phase 1.6 workflow.**
            *   `PerformanceAnalysisAgent`: (Post-MVP) Integrates profiling tools (cProfile) and analyzes performance metrics.
            *   `FormalVerificationEngine`: Interfaces with Coq (proofs compiled in CI), Isabelle/HOL, and Z3 (SMT solver) for multi-layered verification.
            *   `PredictiveRiskAssessmentModule`: Uses `QuantumRiskPredictor` (trained on historical KG data) to forecast ethical/security risks.
            *   `SelfMonitoringAndAdaptiveHealing`: Monitors system metrics (Prometheus), logs errors, triggers recovery actions.
            *   `ResourceManagementOptimization`: (Post-MVP) Optimizes cloud resource usage, potentially using Kubernetes HPA based on Prometheus metrics.
    *   **Ethical Governance Framework:**
        *   **Project Process Ethics:** Extend the Ethical Governance Framework to evaluate and guide MSGE's own development processes, ensuring they align with ethical principles of **transparency, risk mitigation, and continuous improvement**. This includes using AI-driven roadmap refinement to minimize uncertainty and enhance project success probability, and proactively addressing potential ethical concerns within the development process itself. **Furthermore, to ensure consistent ethical considerations in code contributions, we employ an **Iterative Grading Process** (detailed in [CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution Review Process: Iterative Probability-Based Grading](CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-review-process-iterative-probability-based-grading)) that includes "Ethical Policy Compliance Probability", "Code Style Compliance Probability", and other key quality metrics in code reviews and iterative refinement cycles.**
         *   *EthicalPolicyEngine (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`):* Loads JSON policies (`jsonschema` validation). `enforce_policy` method checks code/metadata against loaded constraints (regex, keyword checks, **AST analysis for transparency**). Returns compliance status. **Automated execution of policy enforcement is now part of the Phase 1.6 workflow.**
         *   *BiasDetectionMitigationModule:* Uses NLP libraries (spaCy, Transformers) or fairness toolkits (Fairlearn) to analyze text (comments, docs) and potentially code structure for bias indicators. (Post-MVP) Implements mitigation strategies (e.g., suggesting alternative phrasing).
         *   *TransparencyExplainabilityModule:* (Planned) Provides API endpoints to retrieve justification for policy violations or agent decisions, potentially querying LLM logs or KG links.
    *   **Formal Verification & Resilience Subsystem:**
        *   *FormalVerificationEngine:* Interfaces with Coq (proofs compiled in CI), Isabelle/HOL, and Z3 (SMT solver) for multi-layered verification.
        *   *QuantumStatePreserver:* (MVP placeholder) Saves quantum states for auditability.
        *   *SelfMonitoringAndAdaptiveHealing:* Prometheus metrics, anomaly detection (post-MVP).
    *   **Continuous Learning & Improvement Loop:**
        *   *PerformanceAnalysisAgent:* (Post-MVP) Benchmarking, profiling, bottleneck analysis.
        *   *ContinuousLearningCore:* ML-driven process adaptation.
        *   *FeedbackCaptureModule:* API endpoints for user feedback.
