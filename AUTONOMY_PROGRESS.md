# Estimated Autonomous Development Progress

This document tracks the estimated progress towards achieving full autonomous software development within the Metamorphic Software Genesis Ecosystem. The table below shows the estimated percentage of tasks the system is expected to be able to complete autonomously (from "Not Started" to "Completed" without manual code modification or system intervention) after the successful completion of each specified task in the roadmap.

These estimates are based on the current understanding of the system's capabilities and the impact of each planned task. They are subject to change as development progresses and new insights are gained from real-world autonomous runs.

For full task details, refer to the [Development Roadmap](ROADMAP.md). For the overall vision and phase goals, see the [Full High-Level Specification](SPECIFICATION.md).

| task_1_8_1     | Enhance Plan Step Identification                 | 40%                                   | Better understanding of plan steps leads to more accurate agent invocation and workflow execution.           |
| task_1_8_2     | Implement Pre-Write Validation per Step          | 50%                                   | Catches critical errors (syntax, basic style/ethics) *before* writing, preventing cascading failures.      |
| task_1_8_3     | Implement Step-Level Remediation Loop            | 60%                                   | Enables the system to fix issues immediately at the source, reducing manual intervention for common errors.  |
| task_1_8_4     | Ensure Post-Write, Step-Level Test Execution     | 68%                                   | Guarantees functional feedback after code changes, essential for catching bugs introduced by generation/merge. |
| task_1_8_5     | Implement Learning from Failures (Data Capture)  | 70%                                   | Foundation for learning; provides data needed to improve future performance and strategies.                  |
| task_1_8_6     | Improve Remediation Strategy & Targeted Feedback | 78%                                   | Makes self-correction smarter and more likely to succeed by prioritizing fixes and providing better LLM prompts. |

| task_1_8_10    | Implement Advanced Code Merging                  | 91%                                   | Reduces a source of *system-introduced* errors (syntax issues from merging), improving overall reliability. |
| task_1_8_11    | Implement Prompt Self-Correction Mechanism       | 95%                                   | Enables the system to adapt its *own* communication strategy with LLMs based on past success/failure.      |
