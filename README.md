### Roadmap Update (v1.1) <a name="roadmap-update-v11"></a>

**Roadmap for Completion (Optimized for Existing Codebase - Iterative MVP Approach)**

#### **Phase 1: MVP - Refine Existing Core (Next ~3 Months) - *Leverage & Focus***

**Key Principle:** *Phase 1 is about *refining and focusing your existing codebase* to meet the MVP definition, not starting from scratch. We use your current agents as a *starting point* for the "barebones" implementations.*

---

**Phase 1 MVP Definition:**  A functional API endpoint (`/genesis/analyze-ethical`) capable of:

1.  **Analyzing Python Code for Ethical Concerns:** Using a configurable policy engine (enforcing BiasRisk, TransparencyScore, and Safety Boundary constraints, configurable via JSON).
2.  **Providing Basic Code Quality Assessment:**  Leveraging `CodeReviewAgent` (Flake8 output reporting via API).
3.  **Generating Placeholder Tests:** Utilizing `TestGenAgent` to create basic pytest placeholder tests for Python code.
4.  **API Access:**  Providing a functional `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint that integrates ethical analysis and code quality checks.

---

**Phase 1 Deliverables:**
1. Functional API endpoint (`/genesis/analyze-ethical`) for ethical code analysis.
2. Basic Ethical Policy Engine enforcing BiasRisk, TransparencyScore, and Safety Boundary constraints, with policies configurable via JSON.

**Phase 1 Actionable Steps (Revised & Iterative - *Build on Existing*):**

* **Month 1: Refine Existing Agents & Ethical Engine Foundation - *MVP Agent Focus & Ethical Core (Iterative)* - (**Existing Codebase Leverage**)**

    *1. **Agent Refinement - *Leverage Existing Agents for MVP* - (**Iterative & Adaptive**):**
        *   **TestGenAgent - MVP Refinement:** **Action:** *Adapt your existing `TestGenAgent`*. *Specific Action:*
            * **Start with your current `TestGenAgent` code.**
            * **Simplify `generate_tests()`**:  Refocus it to generate *basic pytest placeholder tests* as per MVP.  *Initially, prioritize functionality over sophistication*.  You likely already have a `TestGenAgent` - refine it to meet the *minimum MVP requirement* of generating *any* placeholder tests.
            * **Verify Functionality (Unit Tests):** Write unit tests to ensure the *refined* `TestGenAgent` can generate *basic* pytest code.
        *   **CodeReviewAgent - MVP Refinement:** **Action:** *Adapt your existing `CodeReviewAgent`*. *Specific Action:*
            * **Start with your current `CodeReviewAgent` code.**
            * **Simplify `analyze_python()`**: Refocus it to *only* run Flake8 and report basic output.  *Defer more advanced static analysis or Bandit integration for Phase 2*.  Your current agent already runs Flake8 - *simplify* it to just handle that MVP task for now.
            * **Verify Functionality (Unit Tests):** Write unit tests to ensure the *refined* `CodeReviewAgent` can execute Flake8 and parse *basic* output.
        *   **(Iterative Testing - Agent Readiness):** **Action:** *Iteratively test and refine* these agents.  *Specific Action:*
            * **Write unit tests *first* (or concurrently).**
            * **Run tests frequently as you simplify/refine the agents.**
            * **Ensure agents are *operationally ready* for the MVP endpoint.**

    *2. **JSON Schema Design for Ethical Policies:**
        *   **Action:** *Define* a robust JSON schema to represent ethical principles, constraints (BiasRisk, TransparencyScore, SafetyBoundary), categories, and enforcement levels.  *Specific Action:* Create `ethical_policy_schema.json` file defining the schema.
        *   (**Self-Bootstrapping Example**: **Self-Bootstrap (Iterative):**  *Adapt your refined `TestGenAgent`* (from Task 1) to *iteratively generate validation tests* for the `EthicalPolicyEngine` as you define the `ethical_policy_schema.json`.  Test schema loading and basic validation logic *incrementally*.)

    *3. **Ethical Policy Engine (Basic & Configurable):**
        *   **Action:** *Implement* a basic `EthicalPolicyEngine` capable of loading and enforcing ethical policies from JSON configurations (based on `ethical_policy_schema.json`).  Focus on enforcing BiasRisk, TransparencyScore, and SafetyBoundary constraints initially.
        *   **Action:** *Implement* API endpoints for basic policy management (e.g., `/ethical/policy/load`, `/ethical/policy/view`).  Use in-memory storage for policies initially; defer database integration.
        *   (**Automated Testing - Critical & Iterative**): **Self-Bootstrap (Iterative):** *Use your refined `TestGenAgent`* (from Task 1) to *iteratively generate comprehensive unit and integration tests* for the `EthicalPolicyEngine`, focusing on rigorous testing of policy loading, enforcement logic, constraint validation, and API endpoint functionality *incrementally*.

    *4. **GDPR/COPPA Placeholder API (Interface Definition Only):**
        *   **Action:** *Define* placeholder API endpoints (`/ethical/gdpr`, `/ethical/coppa`) with clear request/response interfaces documented in API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).  *Specific Action:* Create API route definitions in `ethical_endpoints.py` but leave the function implementations empty (returning "Not Implemented" responses).

    *5. **Bias Detection Module (Starter Integration - Text Analysis Focus):**
        *   **Action:** *Integrate* a starter-level bias detection library (e.g., `Fairlearn` or basic `transformers` text analysis tools) into the `BiasDetectionMitigationModule`. Focus *initially* on text-based bias detection capabilities for code comments and docstrings.  *Specific Action:* Implement basic text bias analysis within `BiasDetectionMitigationModule` that can be called by the `EthicalPolicyEngine`.

* **Month 2: Integrate Agents & API Endpoint - Specification Analysis & Test Generation (**Iterative Integration**)**
    1. **Integrate Specification Analysis Agent (Iterative Enhancement):**  *Adapt your `SpecificationAnalyzer`* to be ready for the MVP endpoint. *Action:* *Iteratively enhance* `SpecificationAnalyzer` to handle the input expected by the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` endpoint. *Specific Action:* Ensure it can analyze Python code strings and output structured specifications in JSON format relevant to ethical analysis and code quality.
    2. **API Endpoint Integration (`/genesis/analyze-ethical` - Core MVP):**  **Action:** *Implement the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint*. *Specific Action:*
        * **Route code input:**  Ensure the API endpoint correctly receives Python code via POST request.
        * **Orchestrate Agents:** Wire up the refined `CodeReviewAgent` and `EthicalPolicyEngine` (and basic `BiasDetectionMitigationModule`) to be called by this endpoint.  *Start with a simple sequential flow*.
        * **Return JSON Response:** Format the output from the agents and policy engine into a JSON response as defined in the MVP.
    3. **Automated Testing - API Endpoint & Agent Integration:** (**Iterative Testing**): *Write integration tests* for the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint. Focus on testing the *integration* of the agents and the endpoint, ensuring data flows correctly and the API returns the expected JSON response. *Action:* *Create integration tests* in `tests/integration/test_api_ethical_analysis.py`. *Specific Action:* Use `pytest` and API client libraries to send requests to the endpoint and validate the responses.
    4. **CI/CD Integration - MVP Endpoint Tests:** Extend the CI pipeline to automatically run the integration tests for the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` endpoint. *Action:* *Modify* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include execution of the new integration tests. *Specific Action:* Add a step in the CI workflow to discover and run pytest files in `tests/integration/`.

* **Month 3: MVP Refinement & Documentation - API Focus & Initial Polish (MVP Completion)**
    1. **Refine MVP API Endpoint (`/genesis/analyze-ethical` - Polish):** *Polish the MVP API endpoint* based on testing and initial feedback.  *Action:* *Refine error handling, response formatting, and performance* of the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` endpoint. *Specific Action:*  Implement better error responses, improve JSON output structure, and optimize for latency.
    2. **Basic Documentation - MVP API Endpoint:** *Document the MVP API endpoint*. *Action:* *Create basic documentation* for the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint. *Specific Action:*  Update `README.md` with clear instructions on how to use the endpoint, request/response examples, and expected output.
    3. **Initial MVP Release (Internal/Alpha):** *Release an initial MVP version* for internal testing or alpha users. *Action:* *Prepare a minimal release* of the MVP. *Specific Action:* Tag a release in Git, ensure Docker image is buildable and runnable with the MVP functionality.
    4. **Gather Feedback - MVP Endpoint:** *Gather feedback on the MVP API endpoint*. *Action:* *Collect feedback* from internal testers or alpha users on the usability and functionality of the `/genesis/analyze-ethical` endpoint. *Specific Action:* Set up a feedback mechanism (e.g., a simple form or a dedicated communication channel) and actively solicit feedback.
