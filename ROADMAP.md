## Roadmap: Phase 1.5 - Workflow Automation Side Project (Weeks 7-8) ðŸš€

**Iteration Goal:** Implement Level 1 and Level 2 of the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow" to enhance development efficiency for Phase 2 and beyond.

*Ethical Note:* By improving workflow automation, we aim to accelerate development and improve the overall quality and reliability of the Metamorphic Ecosystem, contributing to its ethical goals of creating robust and dependable software.

**Success Metrics for Phase 1.5:**
*   Level 1 Documentation Complete: âœ… COMPLETE: `docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md` file created and populated with detailed documentation of the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow," including the "Ideal Self-Driving Prompt" and usage guide. (Week 7)
*   Level 2 Workflow Driver Component Partially Implemented: `src/core/automation/workflow_driver.py` component partially implemented, including core functionalities for prompt generation, LLM interaction, basic output parsing, and a command-line interface in `run_genesis.py`. (Week 8)
*   Basic Workflow Driver Tests Implemented: Basic tests for load_roadmap and list_files were attempted.
*   Command-Line Interface and `list_files` method - INCOMPLETE: `run_genesis.py` is partially created to test file list, and currently works.

**Phase 1.5 Focus (Weeks 7-8):**

1. **Level 1: Documentation (Week 7 - 2 days) - âœ… COMPLETE:**

6. **Level 2: Workflow Driver Component (Week 7-8 - 5 days):**
   * **Task 2.1 (Week 7 - 2 days):** âœ… **COMPLETE**
        *   Priority: High
        *   Task ID: task_2_1
        *   Relevant Files: src/core/automation/workflow_driver.py, docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md
        *   Implement `workflow_driver.py` with prompt generation, LLM interaction, and basic output parsing. **âœ… COMPLETE - basic `list_files` implemented.**
        *   **Entry Criteria:** `docs/workflows/markdown_automation.md` is complete. Basic project structure is set up.
        *   **Success Criteria:** `workflow_driver.py` contains a `WorkflowDriver` class with the following methods:
            *   `__init__(self)`: Initializes the class (can be empty).
            *   `load_roadmap(self, roadmap_path: str)`: Reads and parses `ROADMAP.md` into a usable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries). **IMPLEMENTED - HARDCODED OUTPUT**
            *    Implements basic file loading, using only safe libraries.
            *   Includes the `list_files` command. **âœ… COMPLETE - returns empty list.**
            *   `__repr__(self)` - This will ensure easier output for logging to ensure that the models read the data correctly.
        *   **Expected Grade Outcome:** 100% (Basic class structure and hardcoded `load_roadmap` implemented, no file IO, `list_files` empty, and tests passing.)
        *   **Decomposition Hints:**
            * Sub-task 1: Implement reading ROADMAP.md into a dictionary of tasks.
            * Sub-task 2: Implement logging to aid debugging.
            * Sub-task 3: Add basic error handling for potential exceptions.
            * Sub-task 4: Implement the `list_files` method (can be basic initial implementation). **âœ… COMPLETE - BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**
   * **Task 2.2 (Week 8 - 2 days) - CURRENT FOCUS:**
        *   Priority: High
        *   Task ID: task_2_2
        *   Relevant Files: run_genesis.py, src/core/automation/workflow_driver.py
        *   Implement command-line interface in `run_genesis.py` to execute `WorkflowDriver` and display output. **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - basic script created to instantiate WorkflowDriver and call load_roadmap and list_files.**
        *   **Entry Criteria:** `WorkflowDriver` class exists with `load_roadmap` method.
        *   **Success Criteria:** `run_genesis.py` can:
            *   Instantiate `WorkflowDriver`. **âœ… COMPLETE**
            *   Call `load_roadmap` and display the parsed task list in a human-readable format.  **âœ… COMPLETE**
            * Has `list_files` functionality (calls and prints results). **âœ… COMPLETE**
            * Has appropriate doc strings.
        *   **Expected Grade Outcome:** 60% (Basic script that can load and run WorkflowDriver with basic output. Requires more functionality and docstrings.).
   * **Task 2.3 (Week 8 - 1 day):**
        *   Priority: Medium
        *   Task ID: task_2_3
        *   Relevant Files: src/core/automation/workflow_driver.py, tests/test_workflow_driver.py
        *   **Debugging Markdown Automation & Workflow Driver**: Focus on debugging the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow" to resolve issues where it attempts to re-create existing files (e.g., `workflow_driver.py`, `test_workflow_driver.py`). Enhance `WorkflowDriver` to correctly identify existing files and modify them appropriately instead of re-creating them. **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. Attemted to add unittests but there were problems with the tests. Will refine tests in the next cycle.**
        *   **Entry Criteria:** `WorkflowDriver` has basic functionality and a command-line interface.
        *   **Success Criteria:**
            *   Unit tests exist for `load_roadmap` and other core methods.  **IMPLEMENTED - BASIC TESTS ONLY - Previous tests currently verify `load_roadmap`**
            *   The `WorkflowDriver` can successfully load and parse `ROADMAP.md` **NOT YET - HARDCODED OUTPUT ONLY**
            *   Code is verified that it doesn't have any problems, especially security problems and potential code injection, to help verify that this doesn't have any potential problems.
            *   **Markdown Automation Debugging**: The Markdown Automation workflow, when using the `WorkflowDriver`, no longer attempts to re-create `workflow_driver.py` or `test_workflow_driver.py`. It correctly identifies existing files.
            *   **File Existence Check**: `WorkflowDriver` incorporates logic to check for file existence before attempting to create or modify files, preventing accidental overwrites or redundant creations.
        *   **Decomposition Hints:**
            * Sub-task 1: Create initial unit tests for core `WorkflowDriver` functionality.
            * Sub-task 2: Implement logging to aid debugging.
            * Sub-task 3: Add basic error handling for potential exceptions.
            * Sub-task 4:  Add tests for file reading functionality
            * **Sub-task 5: Analyze Markdown Automation Prompts**: Review the prompts used in the Markdown Automation workflow to ensure they are not instructing the LLM to re-create existing files unnecessarily.
            * **Sub-task 6: Implement File Existence Check in `WorkflowDriver`**: Add functionality within `WorkflowDriver`**: Add functionality within `WorkflowDriver` (and potentially the `write_file` tool if the driver uses it) to check if a file exists before attempting to create it.
            * **Sub-task 7: Add Unit Tests for File Handling**: Add unit tests to `tests/test_workflow_driver.py` to verify: a) that `WorkflowDriver` correctly identifies existing files, b) that it modifies existing files as intended (if modification is the goal), and c) that it prevents redundant file creation.
            * **Sub-task 8: Run Existing Unit Tests**: Run existing unit tests after implementing file existence checks to ensure no regressions are introduced.
            * **Sub-task 9: Manual Security Review**: Perform a quick manual security review of the implemented file existence check logic in `WorkflowDriver` to ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced.
        *   **New Sub-task 10: Add a test that implements an ethical code block to the file. Verify it rejects code injection, by throwing a code injection warning.**
        * **Expected Grade Outcome:** 20% (Tests were attempted, but test structure was not stable. Further testing is required.).
   * **Target Deliverable:** Partially functional `workflow_driver.py` component with initial testing. Command-line interface minimally implemented.

7. **Review & Sign-off (End of Week 8 - 1 day):**
   * **Task 3.1 (Week 8 - 1 day):**
        *   Priority: Low
        *   Task ID: task_3_1
        *   Relevant Files: This ROADMAP.md
        *   Review all deliverables for Phase 1.5 against success metrics. Get sign-off for phase completion.
        *   **Entry Criteria:** All Level 1 and Level 2 tasks are complete.
