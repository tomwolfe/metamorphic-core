**Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (Version 1.0): High-Level Specification (AGPLv3 Licensed)**
**Detailed Version (Community-Driven & Passion-Project Focused)**

**Executive Summary:**

The Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (ASGE) is a transformative open-source platform (AGPLv3) designed to revolutionize software development through **ethical actionability, adaptive learning, and human-AI symbiosis.** As a community-driven passion project, it aims for exceptional software quality, efficiency, and ethical responsibility by synergistically combining advanced AI with human expertise. Envisioned for creating robust software, especially for complex, long-context tasks, ASGE prioritizes verifiable reliability, resource efficiency, and transparent ethical operations, aligning with frameworks like the **EU AI Act, GDPR, and COPPA.** Long-term sustainability is fostered through vibrant community contribution, resourceful operation, and a commitment to open knowledge. This document outlines the core design, architecture, high-level post-MVP roadmap, technical specifications, and KPIs for Version 1.0. While this specification details the long-term vision, the **current development focus is on delivering the Phase 1 MVP** as outlined in the main roadmap section â€“ establishing the foundational configurable ethical analysis capability.

**I. Foundational Design Principles:**

1.  **Human-AI Symbiosis**: Balancing AI automation with essential human oversight for strategy, nuance, and ethics.
    *   *Mechanism:* AI handles efficiency (code generation, analysis); humans provide strategic direction (specifications, feedback) and ethical judgment (ERB, overrides).
    *   *Oversight:* Ethical Review Board (ERB, 5+ members, quarterly reviews, 3-vote majority for overrides) provides expert governance. User-friendly interfaces (web UI planned) enable stakeholder interaction. Open contribution processes manage community input.

2.  **Ethical Actionability**: Embedding demonstrable and enforceable ethics into every component.
    *   *Mechanism:* Ethics integrated by design. The **`EthicalGovernanceEngine`** uses configurable JSON policies (aligned with EU AI Act, GDPR, COPPA) to enforce constraints during validation. Policies are version-controlled and community-vetted. Monthly audits by ERB ensure accountability.
    *   *Modules:* Proactive **Bias Detection & Mitigation Module** analyzes code/outputs. **Transparency & Explainability Module** (planned) will provide APIs to query LLM rationale (e.g., "Why was this code flagged?"). Clear Human Override pathways exist via the ERB interface (planned). Continuous AI self-assessment against policies generates compliance reports.

3.  **Adaptive Learning Fabric**: Intelligently designed for continuous improvement.
    *   *Mechanism:* Data-driven adaptation using performance metrics (KPIs), agent feedback (e.g., code review results), and user input.
    *   *Modules:* **Continuous Learning & Adaptation Core** uses ML techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from agent feedback, A/B testing of generation strategies) to enhance agent performance and ethical alignment. **Self-Monitoring & Adaptive Healing Subsystem** uses health checks (API latency, resource usage) and error logs to trigger automated recovery procedures (e.g., restarting agents, rolling back configurations). **Predictive Risk Assessment Module** uses historical data and modeling (e.g., `QuantumRiskPredictor`) to forecast potential issues.

4.  **Cyber-Physical Resilience & Resource Efficiency**: Prioritizing security, robustness, and sustainability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Formal verification (**Coq** proofs compiled in CI for core logic like boundary detection; **Isabelle/HOL** planned for critical algorithms) provides mathematical guarantees. Strategic use of memory-safe **Rust** for safety-critical modules (e.g., verification components, policy engine core) and high-performance **Go** for concurrent agents (e.g., API handlers, parallel analysis tasks). Proactive error handling (e.g., retries, graceful degradation) built into agents and orchestration. Core focus on resource optimization (caching, efficient algorithms, potential serverless components).
    *   *Targets:* 25% resource reduction, 40% performance improvement (12 months post-Phase 2 completion).

5.  **Knowledge-Based Problem Solving**: Leveraging and evolving knowledge for advanced software genesis.
    *   *Mechanism:* The **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG)** acts as the central "memory," storing semantic representations of code, specifications, ethical rules, security findings, performance data, and community feedback. The **Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer** queries the KG for relevant context before prompting LLMs (Gemini, Hugging Face, others planned). It manages long contexts using techniques like **semantic chunking** (`SemanticChunker`) and **recursive summarization** (`RecursiveSummarizer`). It routes tasks to appropriate LLMs based on capability/cost and handles API failover. Specialized **AI Agents** query the KG and LLM Orchestrator to perform their tasks (analysis, generation, review).

6.  **Open Innovation & Global Accessibility**: Fostering a vibrant community and broad usability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Actively manage community contributions via **GitHub** (primary repository). Adhere to open standards (OpenAPI for APIs) and prioritize FOSS tools (Python, Go, Rust, Coq, ZAP, etc.).
    *   *Future:* Develop a **Community Contribution Platform** (web UI). Implement localization (10+ languages). Support diverse open-source LLMs (Alpa, StarCoder) to reduce vendor lock-in and improve global accessibility.

**II. System Architecture & Core Workflow:**

          |--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---(Feedback Loops, Monitoring, Validation)
```

*   **Core Workflow Example (Code Analysis - MVP Focus):**
    1.  User submits code via API (`/genesis/analyze-ethical`).
    2.  API Gateway routes request.
    3.  `Metamorphic Core` receives request.
    4.  `Ethical Governance Layer` (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`) loads the relevant JSON policy.
    5.  `Metamorphic Core` invokes `CodeReviewAgent` (Flake8) and `TestGenAgent` (placeholders).
    6.  `CodeReviewAgent` analyzes code, results stored temporarily/sent back.
    7.  `EthicalGovernanceEngine` enforces loaded policy against the code and analysis results.
    8.  Results (Flake8 output, ethical status, placeholder tests) are aggregated by the `Metamorphic Core`.
    9.  Results potentially stored in KG.
    10. Formatted JSON response returned via API Gateway.
    11. (Parallel/Async) `SecurityAgent` might trigger ZAP scan if applicable (post-MVP focus for full integration).
    12. (Post-MVP) Feedback loops update KG and `ContinuousLearningCore`.
