# Full High-Level Specification (Detailed Vision)

## Phase 1.6 Focused Specification Summary <a name="phase-1-6-focused-specification-summary"></a>

**Purpose:** This section provides a concise summary of the full specification, focusing *only* on the elements directly relevant to Phase 1.6. This is intended to provide an actionable and focused guide for the current development iteration. Refer to the sections below for the full, detailed vision.

**Key Goals for Phase 1.6 (from Full Specification):**

*   **Ethical Actionability & Governance (Automated Execution):**
    *   Automate the execution of ethical policy enforcement checks (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`) within the Driver loop.
*   **Automated Quality & Security (Automated Execution):**
    *   Automate the execution of code review (`CodeReviewAgent` - Flake8/Bandit) within the Driver loop.
    *   Automate the execution of security checks (`SecurityAgent` - ZAP/Bandit checks) within the Driver loop.
    *   Automate the execution of tests (`pytest`) within the Driver loop and capture results.
*   **Self-Improving Development Process (Automation Completion):**
    *   **Automate Initial Prompt:** Implement the automation of the initial prompt construction and submission from the CLI **to the new `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint**, eliminating the manual copy-paste step.
    *   **Automate Grade Report Parsing & Actioning:** Implement logic for the Driver to automatically parse its generated Grade Report and determine next steps based on validation results.
    *   **Automate Roadmap Status Update:** Implement logic for the Driver to automatically update the task status in `ROADMAP.json` based on the iteration's outcome.

**Core Workflow Adaptation for Phase 1.6:**

For Phase 1.6, the core workflow (as detailed in Section II of the full specification) is focused on automating the **Initiation** phase and the **Validation (Iterative Loop)** execution and feedback stages.

1.  **Automated Initiation (New):** The CLI will automate the construction and submission of the initial prompt **to the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint**, which triggers the Driver LLM.
2.  **Autonomous Workflow Execution (Driver LLM Loop - Automated):** The Driver LLM, triggered by the automated prompt via the API, autonomously selects tasks, generates plans, and executes plan steps.
3.  **Automated Validation (Orchestrated and Executed by Driver):** The Driver orchestrates and *automatically executes* validation steps as part of the plan execution. This includes:
    *   **Automated Code Quality Checks:** Executing `CodeReviewAgent` (Flake8/Bandit).
    *   **Automated Security Scans:** Executing `SecurityAgent` (ZAP/Bandit checks).
    *   **Automated Test Execution:** Running `pytest` on generated tests.
    *   **Automated Ethical Assessment:** Executing `EthicalGovernanceEngine` checks.
    *   Validation results are captured, logged, and feed into the Grade Report.
4.  **Automated Feedback & Roadmap Update:** The Driver automatically parses the Grade Report, determines the outcome, and *automatically updates the task status in `ROADMAP.json`*.
5.  **Knowledge Graph Interaction:** Agents may query and update the Knowledge Graph (KG schema expansion is a Phase 2 Iteration 2 focus).
6.  **Integration:** Validated code is written via `write_file`.
7.  **User Review:** User reviews the outputs and logs after the automated iteration is complete.

*Note: This summary is intended to be a concise and actionable guide for Phase 1.6. For full context and long-term vision, please refer to the detailed sections below.*

**Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (Version 1.0): High-Level Specification (Detailed Vision) (AGPLv3 Licensed)**
**Detailed Version (Community-Driven & Passion-Project Focused)**

**Executive Summary:**

The Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (ASGE) is a transformative open-source platform (AGPLv3) designed to revolutionize software development through **ethical actionability, adaptive learning, and human-AI symbiosis.** As a community-driven passion project, it aims for exceptional software quality, efficiency, and ethical responsibility by synergistically combining advanced AI with human expertise. Envisioned for creating robust software, especially for complex, long-context tasks, ASGE prioritizes verifiable reliability, resource efficiency, and transparent ethical operations, aligning with frameworks like the **EU AI Act, GDPR, and COPPA.** **A key aspect of our methodology is an Iterative Grading Process, ensuring continuous quality improvement and verifiable software artifacts. We have successfully completed Phase 1.5, implementing a Markdown-Only Automation Workflow that automates the core Driver LLM loop (task selection, planning, agent invocation, file writing). We are now focused on Phase 1.6: Enhanced Workflow Automation, completing the end-to-end automation layer by automating workflow initiation, validation execution, feedback processing, and roadmap status updates.** This strategic investment in our own development process significantly improves software quality AND accelerates our development cycles for the Metamorphic Ecosystem itself. Long-term sustainability is fostered through vibrant community contribution, resourceful operation, and a commitment to open knowledge. This document outlines the core design, architecture, high-level roadmap, technical specifications, and KPIs for Version 1.0.

**I. Foundational Design Principles:**

1.  **Human-AI Symbiosis**: Balancing AI automation with essential human oversight for strategy, nuance, and ethics.
    *   *Mechanism:* AI handles efficiency (code generation, analysis, *validation execution, roadmap update*); humans provide strategic direction (specifications, feedback) and ethical judgment (ERB, overrides).
    *   *Oversight:* Ethical Review Board (ERB, 5+ members, quarterly reviews, 3-vote majority for overrides) provides expert governance. User-friendly interfaces (web UI planned) enable stakeholder interaction. Open contribution processes manage community input.

2.  **Ethical Actionability**: Embedding demonstrable and enforceable ethics into every component.
    *   *Mechanism:* Ethics integrated by design. The **`EthicalGovernanceEngine`** uses configurable JSON policies (aligned with EU AI Act, GDPR, COPPA) to enforce constraints during validation. Policies are version-controlled and community-vetted. Monthly audits by ERB ensure accountability. **Automated execution of ethical checks is now part of the autonomous workflow in Phase 1.6.**
    *   *Modules:* Proactive **Bias Detection & Mitigation Module** analyzes code/outputs. **Transparency & Explainability Module** (planned) will provide APIs to retrieve justification for policy violations or agent decisions, potentially querying LLM logs or KG links. Clear Human Override pathways exist via the ERB interface (planned). Continuous AI self-assessment against policies generates compliance reports.

3.  **Adaptive Learning Fabric**: Intelligently designed for continuous improvement.
    *   *Mechanism:* Data-driven adaptation using performance metrics (KPIs), agent feedback (e.g., code review results), and user input.
    *   *Modules:* **Continuous Learning & Adaptation Core** uses ML techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from agent feedback, A/B testing of generation strategies) to enhance agent performance and ethical alignment. **Self-Monitoring & Adaptive Healing Subsystem** uses health checks (API latency, resource usage) and error logs to trigger automated recovery procedures (e.g., restarting agents, rolling back configurations). **Predictive Risk Assessment Module** uses historical data and modeling (e.g., `QuantumRiskPredictor`) to forecast potential issues.

4.  **Cyber-Physical Resilience & Resource Efficiency**: Prioritizing security, robustness, and sustainability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Formal verification (**Coq** proofs compiled in CI for core logic like boundary detection; **Isabelle/HOL** planned for critical algorithms) provides mathematical guarantees. Strategic use of memory-safe **Rust** for safety-critical modules (e.g., verification components, policy engine core) and high-performance **Go** for concurrent agents (e.g., API handlers, parallel analysis tasks). Proactive error handling (e.g., retries, graceful degradation) built into agents and orchestration. Core focus on resource optimization (caching, efficient algorithms, potential serverless components).
    *   *Targets:* 25% resource reduction, 40% performance improvement (12 months post-Phase 2 completion).

5.  **Knowledge-Based Problem Solving**: Leveraging and evolving knowledge for advanced software genesis.
    *   *Mechanism:* The **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG)** acts as the central "memory," storing semantic representations of code, specifications, ethical rules, security findings, performance data, and community feedback. The **Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer** queries the KG for relevant context before prompting LLMs (Gemini, Hugging Face, others planned). It manages long contexts using techniques like **semantic chunking** (`SemanticChunker`) and **recursive summarization** (`RecursiveSummarizer`). It routes tasks to appropriate LLMs based on capability/cost and handles API failover. Specialized **AI Agents** query the KG and LLM Orchestrator to perform their tasks (analysis, generation, review).

6.  **Open Innovation & Global Accessibility**: Fostering a vibrant community and broad usability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Actively manage community contributions via **GitHub** (primary repository). Adhere to open standards (OpenAPI for APIs) and prioritize FOSS tools (Python, Go, Rust, Coq, ZAP, etc.).
        *   **AI-Augmented Project Planning:** Integrate AI-driven iterative roadmap refinement, inspired by the process used to develop MSGE itself. This includes AI-assisted risk assessment, task breakdown, and continuous plan optimization, aiming to minimize uncertainty and maximize project success probability. **The completion of the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow" in Phase 1.5 and Phase 1.6 provides a foundational step towards this, demonstrating our commitment to self-improvement and efficient, transparent workflows by automating the core Driver LLM execution loop, validation, and roadmap updates.**
    *   *Future:* Develop a **Community Contribution Platform** (web UI). Implement localization (10+ languages). Support diverse open-source LLMs (Alpa, StarCoder) to reduce vendor lock-in and improve global accessibility.

```

*   **Core Workflow Example (Post-Phase 1.6):**
    1.  User initiates the automated workflow via the CLI (`python src/cli/main.py`). The CLI automatically gathers context (specs, policies, documentation) and **calls the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint** to submit it to the Driver LLM.
    2.  The **Driver LLM** (within `Metamorphic Core`), triggered by the API call, receives the context, loads the `ROADMAP.json` (using the path provided via the API), and enters its `autonomous_loop()`.
    3.  The Driver autonomously selects the next task with status "Not Started".
    4.  The Driver generates a step-by-step solution plan for the selected task (orchestrating LLM calls via `LLMOrchestrator`).
    5.  The Driver iterates through the plan steps.
    6.  For steps requiring code generation, the Driver automatically invokes the **Coder LLM** (via `LLMOrchestrator`) with a specific prompt for that step.
    7.  For steps requiring file operations, the Driver automatically uses the `write_file` or `list_files` tools.
    8.  The Driver orchestrates and *automatically executes* validation steps as part of the plan execution:
        *   Code Quality (`CodeReviewAgent` - Flake8, Bandit).
        *   Security Scans (`SecurityAgent` - ZAP).
        *   Testing (`TestGenAgent` - placeholder/basic, *automatically run via pytest*).
        *   Ethical Assessment (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`).
    9.  Validation results (Flake8 output, ethical status, test results, security findings) are captured, logged, and feed into the Grade Report.
    10. The Driver logs the progress and results of the iteration, including a structured JSON Grade Report.
    11. The Driver *automatically parses* the Grade Report and determines the outcome (e.g., success, failure, needs manual review).
    12. The Driver *automatically updates the status* of the current task in `ROADMAP.json` based on the determined outcome.
    13. The Driver repeats the loop (steps 3-12) until no "Not Started" tasks remain in the roadmap.
    14. **(Iterative Grading & Refinement):** The user reviews the outputs of the autonomous iteration (generated code, reports, logs, *updated roadmap status*). A reviewer assesses the changes across multiple quality dimensions, including **code style, ethical compliance, test success probability, non-regression probability, and security soundness**, and assigns a probability-based grade with actionable feedback. This feedback guides the user's next interaction (initiating another automated iteration via the CLI) to refine the generated artifacts.

        *(For full details on the grading process, see [**CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution Review Process: Iterative Probability-Based Grading**](CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-review-process-iterative-probability-based-grading)).*

    **With the completion of Phase 1.6, the Metamorphic Core now orchestrates the entire development iteration autonomously, from initiation via CLI/API through validation execution, grade report parsing, and roadmap status updates. The user's role shifts from manual step execution to initiating the loop and reviewing the results.**

*   **Key Components (Detailed):**
    *   **Human Input & Oversight Interface:** (Planned Web UI) Secure portal for spec submission (text, later diagrams), configuration, feedback, ethical guidance input, ERB overrides, progress dashboards. The CLI (`src/cli/main.py`) now serves as the primary *initiation* interface for the automated workflow. **This CLI now calls the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint to trigger the autonomous loop.**
    *   **Metamorphic Core (Adaptive AI Orchestration):**
        *   *Dynamic Knowledge Graph:* Neo4j or similar graph DB storing nodes (code chunks, specs, policies, vulnerabilities, tests, metrics) and semantic relationships. Enables complex querying for context retrieval and pattern analysis.
        *   *Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer:* Manages API calls to multiple LLMs (Gemini, Hugging Face, potentially OpenAI). Implements context window management (semantic chunking, summarization), cost/latency optimization (model selection based on task complexity), robust retries, and failover logic. Uses `TokenAllocator` for budget management. **This layer is now orchestrated by the autonomous Driver LLM, triggered via the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint.**
        *   *Modular AI Agent Network:*
            *   `SpecificationAnalysisAgent`: Parses natural language/structured input into formal requirements, potentially using AST analysis and LLMs.

            *   `CodeReviewAgent`: Runs static analysis with **Flake8** for code quality. **Integrated into `/genesis/analyze-ethical` API endpoint. Automated execution is now part of the Phase 1.6 workflow.**
            *   `SecurityAgent`: Orchestrates security tools (ZAP DAST now; SAST via Bandit/Semgrep later). Analyzes results, stores findings in KG. **Automated execution of relevant checks is now part of the Phase 1.6 workflow.**
            *   `PerformanceAnalysisAgent`: (Post-MVP) Integrates profiling tools (cProfile) and analyzes performance metrics.
            *   `FormalVerificationEngine`: Interfaces with Coq (proofs compiled in CI), Isabelle/HOL, and Z3 (SMT solver) for multi-layered verification.
            *   `PredictiveRiskAssessmentModule`: Uses `QuantumRiskPredictor` (trained on historical KG data) to forecast ethical/security risks.
            *   `SelfMonitoringAndAdaptiveHealing`: Monitors system metrics (Prometheus), logs errors, triggers recovery actions.
            *   `ResourceManagementOptimization`: (Post-MVP) Optimizes cloud resource usage, potentially using Kubernetes HPA based on Prometheus metrics.
    *   **Ethical Governance Framework:**
        *   **Project Process Ethics:** Extend the Ethical Governance Framework to evaluate and guide MSGE's own development processes, ensuring they align with ethical principles of **transparency, risk mitigation, and continuous improvement**. This includes using AI-driven roadmap refinement to minimize uncertainty and enhance project success probability, and proactively addressing potential ethical concerns within the development process itself. **Furthermore, to ensure consistent ethical considerations in code contributions, we employ an **Iterative Grading Process** (detailed in [CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution Review Process: Iterative Probability-Based Grading](CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-review-process-iterative-probability-based-grading)) that includes "Ethical Policy Compliance Probability", "Code Style Compliance Probability", and other key quality metrics in code reviews and iterative refinement cycles.**
         *   *EthicalPolicyEngine (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`):* Loads JSON policies (`jsonschema` validation). `enforce_policy` method checks code/metadata against loaded constraints (regex, keyword checks, **AST analysis for transparency**). Returns compliance status. **Automated execution of policy enforcement is now part of the Phase 1.6 workflow.**
         *   *BiasDetectionMitigationModule:* Uses NLP libraries (spaCy, Transformers) or fairness toolkits (Fairlearn) to analyze text (comments, docs) and potentially code structure for bias indicators. (Post-MVP) Implements mitigation strategies (e.g., suggesting alternative phrasing).
         *   *TransparencyExplainabilityModule:* (Planned) Provides API endpoints to retrieve justification for policy violations or agent decisions, potentially querying LLM logs or KG links.
    *   **Formal Verification & Resilience Subsystem:**
        *   *FormalVerificationEngine:* Interfaces with Coq (proofs compiled in CI), Isabelle/HOL, and Z3 (SMT solver) for multi-layered verification.
        *   *QuantumStatePreserver:* (MVP placeholder) Saves quantum states for auditability.
