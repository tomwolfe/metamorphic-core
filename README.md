## VIII. Conclusion

The Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem Version 1.0 is a transformative approach to software development. By intelligently orchestrating advanced AI, deeply integrating ethical considerations, and embracing continuous data-driven learning, it is poised to deliver unprecedented levels of software quality, efficiency, and ethical responsibility.  Its design directly addresses the challenges of complex AI tasks and ensures long-term viability through resource efficiency and a robust financial strategy.  With a phased implementation and clear success metrics, this Ecosystem is not just building the future of software, but building a future where software is inherently more reliable, efficient, ethically sound, and truly serves humanity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Google Gemini API Key
- Hugging Face API Key (optional)
- GitHub API Key (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomwolfe/metamorphic-core.git
cd metamorphic-core
```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify `.env` with your API keys:
```env
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. **Start Redis (optional)**:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml.example up -d redis
```

4. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

### Running the API Server

```bash
cd src/api
python server.py
```

The API server will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:50000/`.

### API Endpoints

Current Functionality:

- `/generate` (GET): Check system status
- `/ethical/analyze` (POST): Analyze code for ethical considerations
- `/ethical/solve-math` (POST): Test mathematical problem-solving
- `/ethical/audit/{state_id}` (GET): Retrieve audit trail data
- `/ethical/visualize/{state_id}` (GET): Obtain visualization data
