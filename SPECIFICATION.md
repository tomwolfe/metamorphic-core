# Full High-Level Specification (Detailed Vision)

## Phase 1.8 Focused Specification Summary <a name="phase-1-8-focused-specification-summary"></a>

**Purpose:** This section provides a concise summary of the full specification, focusing *only* on the elements directly relevant to Phase 1.8. This is intended to provide an actionable and focused guide for the current development iteration. Refer to the sections below for the full, detailed vision.

**Key Goals for Phase 1.8 (from Full Specification):**

*   **Hardened Autonomous Loop:** Make the core workflow significantly more robust and less prone to getting stuck on basic errors.
*   **Advanced Remediation:** Implement more sophisticated self-correction mechanisms based on detailed validation feedback and learning.
*   **Learning from Failures:** Establish systems to capture, analyze, and learn from autonomous workflow failures.

**Core Workflow Adaptation for Phase 1.8:**

For Phase 1.8, the core workflow (as detailed in Section II of the full specification) will be significantly enhanced to improve resilience and self-correction:

1.  **Automated Initiation:** The CLI automates the construction and submission of the initial prompt to the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint, which triggers the Driver LLM.
2.  **Autonomous Workflow Execution (Driver LLM Loop):** The Driver LLM, triggered by the API call, autonomously selects tasks, generates plans, and executes plan steps.
3.  **Enhanced Step Processing:** For steps involving code generation:
    *   The Driver invokes the Coder LLM to generate a code snippet.
    *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Pre-Write Validation:** The Driver performs basic syntax, style, and ethical checks on the *generated snippet* (or the merged code) *before* writing to the file.
    *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Step-Level Remediation:** If pre-write validation fails, the Driver provides targeted feedback to the Coder LLM and retries generating the snippet for *that specific step* (up to a limit).
    *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Advanced Code Merging:** If pre-write validation passes (or after successful step-level remediation), the Driver uses a more robust, AST-aware merging utility to integrate the snippet into the existing file content.
    *   The Driver writes the merged content to the target file.
    *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Post-Write Test Execution:** The Driver automatically triggers relevant tests (using `execute_tests`) after any plan step that successfully modifies code.
4.  **Automated Validation:** The Driver orchestrates and automatically executes validation steps *after* the code modification steps for the task are complete (Code Quality, Security Scans, Test Execution, Ethical Assessment). Validation results are captured, logged, and feed into the Grade Report.
5.  **Automated Feedback & Remediation:** The Driver automatically parses the Grade Report, determines the outcome, and if remediation is recommended, attempts automated self-correction (up to a limit per task). **NEW (Phase 1.8): The remediation strategy is improved to prioritize critical errors (syntax, test failures, high security, ethical rejection) and provide more targeted feedback. It can handle multiple validation failures in one remediation attempt.**
6.  **NEW (Phase 1.8): Learning from Failures:** Detailed data about validation failures, remediation attempts, LLM prompts/responses, and outcomes is logged and stored for analysis and learning.
7.  **NEW (Phase 1.8): Automated Task Decomposition:** The Driver can assess task complexity and automatically break down large tasks into smaller, dependent sub-tasks in the roadmap.
8.  **NEW (Phase 1.8): Task Success Prediction:** The system can predict the likelihood of autonomous success for a task to inform task selection or flag tasks for manual review.
9.  **Automated Roadmap Status Update:** After any remediation attempts, the Driver automatically updates the task status in `ROADMAP.json` based on the final determined outcome.
10. **User Review:** User initiates the workflow and reviews the outputs and logs after the autonomous iteration is complete, especially when tasks are marked "Blocked" due to issues the autonomous system couldn't resolve.

*Note: This summary is intended to be a concise and actionable guide for Phase 1.8. For full context and long-term vision, please refer to the detailed sections below.*

**Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (Version 1.0): High-Level Specification (Detailed Vision) (AGPLv3 Licensed)**
**Detailed Version (Community-Driven & Passion-Project Focused)**

**Executive Summary:**

The Adaptive Software Genesis Ecosystem (ASGE) is a transformative open-source platform (AGPLv3) designed to revolutionize software development through **ethical actionability, adaptive learning, and human-AI symbiosis.** As a community-driven passion project, it aims for exceptional software quality, efficiency, and ethical responsibility by synergistically combining advanced AI with human expertise. Envisioned for creating robust software, especially for complex, long-context tasks, ASGE prioritizes verifiable reliability, resource efficiency, and transparent ethical operations, aligning with frameworks like the **EU AI Act, GDPR, and COPPA.** **A key aspect of our methodology is an Iterative Grading Process, ensuring continuous quality improvement and verifiable software artifacts.**

**Think of it as building a self-driving car:**
*   Phase 1.5-1.7 built the basic car frame, engine, steering, and a simple autopilot that could follow a straight line but crashed on curves or obstacles.
*   Phase 1.8 is adding robust sensors (better validation), anti-lock brakes (pre-write checks), traction control (improved remediation), and a system to learn from near-misses and crashes (failure data capture).
*   Phase 2.2 is adding advanced computer vision (KG for context), better path planning algorithms (enhanced planning agent), and obstacle avoidance (debugging agent).

You need the robust control systems (Phase 1.8) for the advanced perception and planning (Phase 2.2) to be effective and safe.

**We have successfully completed Phase 1.5, implementing a Markdown-Only Automation Workflow that automates the core Driver LLM loop (task selection, planning, agent invocation, file writing). We have also completed Phase 1.6, enhancing this automation layer by automating workflow initiation, validation execution, feedback processing, and roadmap status updates. Phase 1.7: Resilient Workflow & Automated Remediation further enhanced workflow autonomy with dependency awareness and automated self-correction for validation failures (including tests, code style, and ethical transparency). We are now focused on Phase 1.8: Hardened Autonomous Loop & Advanced Remediation, which will significantly improve the robustness and self-correction capabilities of the autonomous workflow loop based on real-world failure analysis, incorporating learning from failures and more sophisticated remediation.** This strategic investment in our own development process significantly improves software quality AND accelerates our development cycles for the Metamorphic Ecosystem itself. Long-term sustainability is fostered through vibrant community contribution, resourceful operation, and a commitment to open knowledge. This document outlines the core design, architecture, high-level roadmap, technical specifications, and KPIs for Version 1.0.

**I. Foundational Design Principles:**

1.  **Human-AI Symbiosis**: Balancing AI automation with essential human oversight for strategy, nuance, and ethics.
    *   *Mechanism:* AI handles efficiency (code generation, analysis, *validation execution, roadmap update*); humans provide strategic direction (specifications, feedback) and ethical judgment (ERB, overrides).
    *   *Oversight:* Ethical Review Board (ERB, 5+ members, quarterly reviews, 3-vote majority for overrides) provides expert governance. User-friendly interfaces (web UI planned) enable stakeholder interaction. Open contribution processes manage community input.

2.  **Ethical Actionability**: Embedding demonstrable and enforceable ethics into every component.
    *   *Mechanism:* Ethics integrated by design. The **`EthicalGovernanceEngine`** uses configurable JSON policies (aligned with EU AI Act, GDPR, COPPA) to enforce constraints during validation. Policies are version-controlled and community-vetted. Monthly audits by ERB ensure accountability. **Automated execution of ethical checks is now part of the autonomous workflow.**
    *   *Modules:* Proactive **Bias Detection & Mitigation Module** analyzes code/outputs. **Transparency & Explainability Module** (planned) will provide APIs to retrieve justification for policy violations or agent decisions, potentially querying LLM logs or KG links. Clear Human Override pathways exist via the ERB interface (planned). Continuous AI self-assessment against policies generates compliance reports.

3.  **Adaptive Learning Fabric**: Intelligently designed for continuous improvement.
    *   *Mechanism:* Data-driven adaptation using performance metrics (KPIs), agent feedback (e.g., code review results), and user input. **Phase 1.8 introduces explicit learning from autonomous workflow failures.**
    *   *Modules:* **Continuous Learning & Adaptation Core** uses ML techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from agent feedback, A/B testing of generation strategies) to enhance agent performance and ethical alignment. **Self-Monitoring & Adaptive Healing Subsystem** uses health checks (API latency, resource usage) and error logs to trigger automated recovery procedures (e.g., restarting agents, rolling back configurations). **Predictive Risk Assessment Module** uses historical data and modeling (e.g., `QuantumRiskPredictor`) to forecast potential issues. **Phase 1.8 adds Task Success Prediction.**

4.  **Cyber-Physical Resilience & Resource Efficiency**: Prioritizing security, robustness, and sustainability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Formal verification (**Coq** proofs compiled in CI for core logic like boundary detection; **Isabelle/HOL** planned for critical algorithms). Strategic use of memory-safe **Rust** for safety-critical modules (e.g., verification components, policy engine core) and high-performance **Go** for concurrent agents (e.g., API handlers, parallel analysis tasks). Proactive error handling (e.g., retries, graceful degradation) built into agents and orchestration. Core focus on resource optimization (caching, efficient algorithms, potential serverless components). **Phase 1.8 improves code merging robustness.**
    *   *Targets:* 25% resource reduction, 40% performance improvement (12 months post-Phase 3 completion).

5.  **Knowledge-Based Problem Solving**: Leveraging and evolving knowledge for advanced software genesis.
    *   *Mechanism:* The **Dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG)** acts as the central "memory," storing semantic representations of code, specifications, ethical rules, security findings, performance data, and community feedback. The **Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer** queries the KG for relevant context before prompting LLMs (Gemini, Hugging Face, others planned). It manages long contexts using techniques like **semantic chunking** (`SemanticChunker`) and **recursive summarization** (`RecursiveSummarizer`). It routes tasks to appropriate LLMs based on capability/cost and handles API failover. Specialized **AI Agents** query the KG and LLM Orchestrator to perform their tasks (analysis, generation, review).

6.  **Open Innovation & Global Accessibility**: Fostering a vibrant community and broad usability.
    *   *Mechanism:* Actively manage community contributions via **GitHub** (primary repository). Adhere to open standards (OpenAPI for APIs) and prioritize FOSS tools (Python, Go, Rust, Coq, ZAP, etc.).
        *   **AI-Augmented Project Planning:** Integrate AI-driven iterative roadmap refinement, inspired by the process used to develop MSGE itself. This includes AI-assisted risk assessment, task breakdown, and continuous plan optimization, aiming to minimize uncertainty and maximize project success probability. **The completion of the "Markdown-Only Automation Workflow" provides a foundational step towards this, demonstrating our commitment to self-improvement and efficient, transparent workflows. Phase 1.8 adds Automated Task Decomposition.**
    *   *Future:* Develop a **Community Contribution Platform** (web UI). Implement localization (10+ languages). Support diverse open-source LLMs (Alpa, StarCoder) to reduce vendor lock-in and improve global accessibility.

*   **Core Workflow Example (Post-Phase 1.8):**
    1.  User initiates the automated workflow via the CLI (`python src/cli/main.py`). The CLI automates the construction and submission of the initial prompt to the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint, which triggers the Driver LLM.
    2.  The **Driver LLM** (within `Metamorphic Core`), triggered by the API call, receives the context, loads the `ROADMAP.json` (using the path provided via the API), and enters its `autonomous_loop()`.
    3.  The Driver autonomously selects the next task with status "Not Started" **(respecting 'depends_on' dependencies and potentially using Task Success Prediction)**. **NEW (Phase 1.8): It may also trigger Automated Task Decomposition for complex tasks.**
    4.  The Driver generates a step-by-step solution plan for the selected task (orchestrating LLM calls via `LLMOrchestrator`).
    5.  The Driver iterates through the plan steps.
    6.  For steps requiring code generation:
        *   The Driver automatically invokes the **Coder LLM** (via `LLMOrchestrator`) with a specific prompt for that step. **NEW (Phase 1.8): Prompt generation logic is improved.**
        *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Pre-Write Validation:** The Driver performs basic syntax, style, and ethical checks on the generated snippet *before* merging.
        *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Step-Level Remediation:** If pre-write validation fails, the Driver provides targeted feedback to the Coder LLM and retries generating the snippet for this step (up to a limit). **NEW (Phase 1.8): Prompt Self-Correction may modify the prompt.**
        *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Advanced Code Merging:** If validation passes, the Driver uses an AST-aware utility to merge the snippet into the existing file content.
        *   The Driver automatically uses the `write_file` tool to write the merged content.
        *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Post-Write Test Execution:** The Driver automatically triggers relevant tests after the write.
    7.  For steps requiring other file operations, the Driver automatically uses the `write_file` or `list_files` tools.
    8.  The Driver orchestrates and *automatically executes* validation steps as part of the plan execution (Code Quality, Security Scans, Testing, Ethical Assessment). Validation results (including detailed error messages/tracebacks) are captured, logged, and feed into the Grade Report.
    9.  The Driver logs the progress and results of the iteration, including a structured JSON Grade Report. **NEW (Phase 1.8): Grade Report and logging are refined to highlight critical errors and distinguish execution errors from findings.**
    10. The Driver *automatically parses* the Grade Report and determines the outcome (e.g., success, failure, needs manual review, regenerate code).
    11. **Automated Remediation:** If the evaluation recommends "Regenerate Code" due to specific validation failures (e.g., test failures, code style violations, ethical transparency issues), the Driver attempts automated self-correction (up to a limit per task). **NEW (Phase 1.8): Remediation strategy is improved, prioritizing critical errors and using more targeted feedback. Detailed failure data is captured (Learning from Failures).**
    12. The Driver *automatically updates the status* of the current task in `ROADMAP.json` based on the final determined outcome (after any remediation attempts).
    13. The Driver repeats the loop (steps 3-12) until no "Not Started" tasks remain in the roadmap.
    14. **(Iterative Grading & Refinement):** The user initiates the loop via CLI and reviews the outputs of the autonomous iteration (generated code, reports, logs, *updated roadmap status*). A reviewer assesses the changes across multiple quality dimensions, including **code style, ethical compliance, test success probability, non-regression probability, and security soundness**, and assigns a probability-based grade with actionable feedback. This feedback guides the user's next interaction (initiating another automated iteration via the CLI) to refine the generated artifacts or manually intervene if the task is blocked.

    **With the completion of Phase 1.8, the Metamorphic Core now orchestrates the entire development iteration autonomously with significantly enhanced resilience and self-correction capabilities. The user's role shifts from manual step execution to initiating the loop and reviewing the results, especially when manual intervention is explicitly recommended after autonomous attempts are exhausted.**

*   **Key Components (Detailed):**
    *   **Human Input & Oversight Interface:** (Planned Web UI) Secure portal for spec submission (text, later diagrams), configuration, feedback, ethical guidance input, ERB overrides, progress dashboards. The CLI (`src/cli/main.py`) now serves as the primary *initiation* interface for the automated workflow. **This CLI now calls the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint to trigger the autonomous loop.**
    *   **Metamorphic Core (Adaptive AI Orchestration):**
        *   *Dynamic Knowledge Graph:* Neo4j or similar graph DB storing nodes (code chunks, specs, policies, vulnerabilities, tests, metrics) and semantic relationships. Enables complex querying for context retrieval and pattern analysis. **NEW (Phase 1.8): Stores detailed failure data for learning.**
        *   *Intelligent LLM Orchestration Layer:* Manages API calls to multiple LLMs (Gemini, Hugging Face, potentially OpenAI). Implements context window management (semantic chunking, summarization), cost/latency optimization (model selection based on task complexity), robust retries, and failover logic. Uses `TokenAllocator` for budget management. **This layer is now orchestrated by the autonomous Driver LLM, triggered via the `/genesis/drive_workflow` API endpoint. NEW (Phase 1.8): Includes Prompt Self-Correction and improved prompt generation logic.**

            *   `ResourceManagementOptimization`: (Post-MVP) Optimizes cloud resource usage, potentially using Kubernetes HPA based on Prometheus metrics.
            *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Automated Task Decomposition Module:** Analyzes task descriptions and dependencies to break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks in the roadmap.
            *   **NEW (Phase 1.8): Advanced Code Merging Utility:** AST-aware code merging to integrate generated snippets reliably.
    *   **Ethical Governance Framework:**
        *   **Project Process Ethics:** Extend the Ethical Governance Framework to evaluate and guide MSGE's own development processes, ensuring they align with ethical principles of **transparency, risk mitigation, and continuous improvement**. This includes using AI-driven roadmap refinement to minimize uncertainty and enhance project success probability, and proactively addressing potential ethical concerns within the development process itself. **Furthermore, to ensure consistent ethical considerations in code contributions, we employ an **Iterative Grading Process** (detailed in [CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution Review Process: Iterative Probability-Based Grading](CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-review-process-iterative-probability-based-grading)) that includes "Ethical Policy Compliance Probability", "Code Style Compliance Probability", and other key quality metrics in code reviews and iterative refinement cycles.**
         *   *EthicalPolicyEngine (`EthicalGovernanceEngine`):* Loads JSON policies (`jsonschema` validation). `enforce_policy` method checks code/metadata against loaded constraints (regex, keyword checks, **AST analysis for transparency**). Returns compliance status. **Automated execution of policy enforcement is now part of the workflow. NEW (Phase 1.8): Used for pre-write validation.**
         *   *BiasDetectionMitigationModule:* Uses NLP libraries (spaCy, Transformers) or fairness toolkits (Fairlearn) to analyze text (comments, docs) and potentially code structure for bias indicators. (Post-MVP) Implements mitigation strategies (e.g., suggesting alternative phrasing).
